  - h: Trump’s fury
    b: |
      On 20 July 2017, US President Donald Trump’s senior advisers attempted an ambush. It was a move that backfired spectacularly.

      According to Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, authors of A Very Stable Genius: Donald J Trump’s Testing of America, Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Director of the Economic Council Gary Cohn arranged a briefing for Trump ostensibly about the situation in Afghanistan. But the advisers were concerned about the “gaping holes in the president’s knowledge of history and of the alliances forged in the wake of World War II that served as the foundation of America’s strength in the world”, and they wanted to set him right.

      Mattis began with a slide which read “The post-war international rules-based order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation.” Steve Bannon, Trump’s adviser and the intellectual support to Trump’s instinctive suspicion of liberal internationalism, sat in on the meeting. According to Rucker and Leonnig, Bannon recoiled: “If you stood up and threatened to shoot [Trump], he couldn’t say ‘post-war rules-based international order’. It’s just not the way he thinks.” Bannon knew his man. Soon Trump was flying into a rage against NATO, free trade agreements and the Iran nuclear deal.

      But Trump’s ignorance is hardly surprising. Although influential leaders like Mattis, Tillerson and Cohn attach increasing importance to the rules-based international order, the concept is not widely understood outside the corridors of power and academia.

      The phrase rules-based international order is relatively young. It was probably first used only in the early 1990s. The term “liberal international order” has a much longer history and is still more widely used – especially in the United States – to describe the post-war international order.
  - h: Australian take up
    b: |
      Australian leaders have only rarely referred to the “liberal international order” but “rules-based international” order has peppered the speeches and policy statements of Australian governments with increasing frequency since an Australian prime minister used the term in 2008. <cite tooltip="1">1</cite> References to the liberal character of the international order have remained few and far between. <cite tooltip="2">2</cite>

      The RBO may just be a semantic innovation. In his book _Fear of Abandonment_, Allan Gyngell argues that one of three enduring threads of Australian foreign policy has been efforts to “support and try to influence, in its own interests, the organisations, rules and norms – the generally accepted standards of behaviour that most states apply to themselves and others – which together made up a rules-based international order”.

      But this doesn’t explain why Australian governments are now talking so much more about the RBO.

      What is the RBO and why has it become so much more important for Australia? Unfortunately, increased use of the term hasn’t always brought greater clarity. The myriad uses of the term sometimes makes it hard to pin down the meaning. Other times the meaning is obscured by opaque bureaucratese.

      This feature attempts to shed some light. It begins by patching together various official statements to paint a picture of the Australian version of the RBO. For those seeking a deeper understanding we have carted Australia’s use of the term chronologically, correlating this with global developments, and providing the views of select Australian policy makers and experts.

  - h: UN-centred
    b: |
      Australian government documents often use the RBO conventionally and expansively to encompass the security and economic order which is centred on “a broad architecture of international governance which has developed since the end of the Second World War”&#58; the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation (and before that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and the International Monetary Foundation.

      “The UN is the prime custodian of the rules-based order ... the UN and its norms are central to a cooperative rules-based approach to global challenges.” It includes “international laws and conventions and regional security architectures” “A rules-based global order means a shared commitment by all countries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules which evolve over time, such as international law and regional security arrangements”. “The values of the (UN) Charter don't only reflect the official stance of the Australian Government They reflect the character of the Australian people.”
  - h: 70 years of peace and prosperity
    b: |
      The RBO is frequently credited with having averted major war. It “has helped support Australia’s security and economic interests for 70 years” because it “supports the peaceful resolution of disputes, facilitates free and open trade and enables unfettered access to the global commons” including “trading routes, secure communications and transport”.

      The RBO “serves to deal with threats before they become existential threats to Australia”. The RBO has limited the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Australia’s support for the Iran nuclear deal “serves our interests in nuclear non-proliferation and in reinforcing the rules-based international system”.  <cite tooltip="3">3</cite>

      The RBO is rarely cited as supporting counter-terrorism, except insofar as it enables international cooperation.
  - h: Constraining power
    b: |
      The RBO limits power and coercion. By preventing the “misuse” of power, the RBO provides an alternative to a world in which “might is right”. <cite tooltip="4">4</cite> The RBO “bounds strategic competition” so that competition can take place “within the framework of international law - not winning through corruption, interference or coercion”, and so that “disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means”.

      But the RBO sometimes plays a less ambitious role. It “fosters cooperation” and “eases tension between states”. And the rules are sometimes just a “component of the international order”. <cite tooltip="5">5</cite>
  - h: US dependent
    b: |
      The RBO both constrains power but is also dependent on US power. The “US anchored rules-based order” was “built” by “the United States and its allies”. The United States “provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today.” The “strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order”. “Australia’s shared interest with the United States in a stable rules-based global order has seen us operate side by side in every major conflict since the First World War”.

      Interestingly, although Australia’s sees “regional security arrangements” as part of the RBO it tends to view Australia’s alliance with the United States as distinct from the RBO. American writers, by contrast, tend to view US alliances as building blocks of the liberal-international order.

      More recently, Australian policy makers have sought to remind Washington that “the United States’ engagement to support a rules-based order is in its own interests and in the interests of wider international stability and prosperity”. The United States should not “lose sight of the wood for the trees … because the big picture is: the rules-based international order”. “Australia does not take for granted a regional default inclination towards the advantages of existing rules-based systems – nor should the United States”.

  - h: The rise of China
    b: |
      The rise of China looms large in Australian policy pronouncements on the RBO but not always clearly. A stable RBO means that “no hostile power in the Indo-Pacific is able to coerce or intimidate others through force or the threat of force.” It is argued that the stability provided by the RBO has enabled China’s rise and that Beijing should therefore support the RBO. Australia supports an RBO that “provide incentives” for China (and India) to “rise peacefully”.

      Prime Minister Rudd urged China to act “in accordance with the rules” and “make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order.” Prime Minister Abbott heard Chinese President Xi Jinping “commit … explicitly to a rule-based international order founded on the principle that we should all treat others as we would be treated ourselves.” Prime Minister Turnbull reminded Premier Li that “Australia and China have both benefited immeasurably from the stability in our region that has been underpinned by the rules-based international order.”

  - h: Friends and allies
    b: |
      Australian support for the RBO is not just about the United States and China. “To support a balance in the Indo–Pacific favourable to our interests and promote an open, inclusive and rules-based region, Australia will also work more closely with the region’s major democracies, bilaterally and in small groupings”.

      The RBO is identified as a central component of Australia’s relationships with the United Nations, NATO, the UK, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand. India is identified both as an important supporter of the RBO and – like China – a major power that the RBO can encourage to rise peacefully. Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga have “demonstrated a willingness to make important contributions to maintaining the rules-based global order”. But when it comes to Malaysia and Singapore, Australia is interested in a more focussed “regional rules-based order”. Although Australia supports a “global” RBO it often highlights the regional dimension.

  - h: Under pressure
    b: |
      “The framework of the rules-based global order is under increasing pressure and has shown signs of fragility”. “Significant forces of change are now buffeting this system” The RBO is challenged by “competition between countries and major powers trying to promote their interests outside of the established rules.” “In some cases, major powers are ignoring or undermining international law”. “Some countries and non-state actors have sought to challenge the rules that govern actions in the global commons of the high seas, cyberspace and space in unhelpful ways, leading to uncertainty and tension”.

  - h: Saving and changing
    b: |
      In the face of these challenges Australia seeks to “preserve the rules-based structure” that has “enabled” the “dynamism of the region”. But Canberra also recognises that “evolution” of the international system is necessary. “Australia will support reforms that give new and emerging powers a greater role in the international system. Some change to institutions and patterns of global cooperation is inevitable, necessary and appropriate to reflect the greater weight of countries such as China, Indonesia, India, Nigeria and Brazil. Reform should be a shared project. Australia is a willing partner.” Prime Minister Gillard called for “a greater role for Asian powers”

      Australia also seeks evolution of the RBO to manage new threats, especially from cyberspace and outerspace. “We seek to ensure that new domains, such as cyberspace, are governed by rules that reinforce stability, support openness and facilitate trade.” “Limiting the militarisation of space will also require the international community to work together to establish and manage a rules-based system – a prospect that does not seem likely in the immediate future.”
  - h: The need for consistency
    b: |
      Australian backing of the RBO requires that we take a “consistent approach”. “We can’t pick and choose”. The 2018 maritime boundary agreement between Australia and Timor-Leste, a much smaller power, is “a testament to the way in which international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, reinforces stability and allows countries to resolve disputes peacefully without resorting to force or coercion. It is an example of the rules-based order in action.”

      On the other hand, “it does not serve our national interests when international institutions demand conformity rather than independent cooperation … we should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community.”
  - h: Tangible deeds
    b: |
      Standing up for the RBO requires “not just words” but “tangible deeds”. Support for the RBO is something Australia has fought for before and may be prepared to fight for again. <cite tooltip="6">6</cite> Australia is “committed to working with the United States and like-minded partners to maintain a rules-based order by making practical and meaningful military commitments where it is in our interests and capacity to do so.” Australia’s “third Strategic Defence Objective is to provide meaningful contributions to global responses to address threats to the rules-based global order which threaten Australia and its interests”. Support for the RBO could see Australia intervene militarily in another country in order to meet the “responsibility to protect”.

      Australian development assistance will be used to “help partner countries join and comply with international rules-based processes.”
