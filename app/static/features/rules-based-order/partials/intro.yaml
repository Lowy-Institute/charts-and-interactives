    ## President Trump's fury

    On 20 July 2017, US President Donald Trump's senior advisers attempted an ambush. It backfired spectacularly.

    According to *Washington Post* journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, authors of _A Very Stable Genius: Donald J Trump's Testing of America_, President Trump's Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn were concerned about the "gaping holes in the president's knowledge of history and the alliances forged in the wake of World War II", and they wanted to set him right.

    Secretary Mattis began a briefing, ostensibly about Afghanistan, with a slide that read "The post-war international rules-based order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation."

    President Trump's adviser Steve Bannon reportedly recalled: "If you stood up and threatened to shoot [Trump], he couldn't say 'post-war rules-based international order'. It's just not the way he thinks." Mr Bannon knew his man.

    Soon, President Trump was flying into a rage against NATO, free trade agreements, and the Iran nuclear deal.

    ## Newer than you think

    President Trump's ignorance is not surprising. The concept of the rules-based order is not widely understood outside the corridors of power and academia. However, establishment figures like Secretary  Mattis, Secretary  Tillerson, and Mr Cohn attach increasing importance to it.

    The phrase 'rules-based order' is relatively young. Only after the Cold War ended did it come into use as a descriptor for the post-Second World War era. (The term 'liberal international order' has a much longer history.)

    ## Trending in Australia

    The term 'liberal international order' has never been popular in Australia but, over the last decade or so, the Australian government has enthusiastically adopted the concept of a 'rules-based international order'.

    This may just be a new way of describing a longstanding policy. In comments provided to the Lowy Institute, former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop agreed that the term is a "semantic innovation". Allan Gyngell, in his book _Fear of Abandonment_, argues that all Australian governments have based their foreign policies on the US alliance, regional engagement, and "the organisations, rules and norms --- the generally accepted standards of behaviour that most states apply to themselves and others --- which  together  [make]  up  a  rules-based  international  order".

    Richard Maude, former Director-General of the Office of National Assessments and current Senior Fellow, Asia Society Policy Institute, says Australian policymakers have had a consistent, if perhaps too often implicit, understanding of what the rules-based order means and  why it is  important:

    > First, global order is shaped primarily by the power of sovereign states. Second, in the decades following the Second World War, a system of multilateral policymaking, and rule-setting institutions was created, alongside the development of international law. This is the rules-based order. Third, to the extent this system can promote global responses to global challenges and protect Australia from coercive power, it serves our interests. Fourth, the liberal dimensions of the order reflect Australian values and interests and should be protected wherever possible.

    According to Hilary Charlesworth, Melbourne Laureate Professor, Melbourne Law School:

    > Australia’s aspirations to ‘good international citizenship’ have waxed and waned in practice. Canberra’s attitude to international law and institutions might be best described as ambivalent. Certainly, Australia has not demonstrated the hostility towards international legal institutions manifested in particular contexts by the superpowers.

    And in the words of Professor Rory Medcalf, Head of the National Security College, ANU:

    > It is striking that advocacy of a rules-based international order has been a broadly consistent thread of Australian foreign policy across five prime ministers and both sides of politics over the past 12 years. That advocacy tended to intensify as the rules-based system came under increasing strain, although has been pragmatically tempered somewhat in 2020 when the world entered a phase of starkly worsening disorder and disruption: note the extensive reference to the rules-based order in Australia’s 2016 Defence White Paper, but the greater focus on power and deterrence in the 2020 Defence Strategic Update.<br style="margin-top: 1em; display: block; content: '';" />This pragmatism is not unique to the COVID-and-after era — indeed from Kevin Rudd onwards, Australian leaders were always conscious that the reality was a ‘rules-and-power-based order’, and we needed to be able to operate in both.

    Our examination of the past decade suggests that the bipartisan continuity noted by Professor Medcalf is a reaction to the major geopolitical shifts in this period: the rise of an assertive China, a more disruptive United States, and  increasingly competitive state behaviour, including in new domains such as cyber and space.

    These trends led Allan Gyngell to conclude, in a June 2018 speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London, that "the order we have known for the past seventy years has ended. It's not being challenged. It's not changing. It's over".

          <p>“Allan is right, the post-war order is gone, but many of its institutions and systems remain. These are under immense pressure from anti-globalisation, populism, nationalism, and authoritarianism, from the Trump administration on one side and China on the other. Getting agreement on responses to many of our most urgent global problems — such as climate change or even fighting the COVID-19 pandemic — is harder than ever.</p>
          <p>Yet there will always be some form of rules-based layer to global order. Much less certain is how effective these elements of the international system will be and whose values they will reflect. In some areas, such as governance of the internet, competing systems and philosophies are emerging. Great power competition and diverging values and interests mean fault-lines are likely to continue to run through much of the multilateral, rule-setting system for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Still, history does not always work in straight lines. We can find space to work with China within some rules-based systems, such as trade for example. America could still rediscover that its security and prosperity are enhanced when it leads by the power of its example and invests in global public goods. It does not look hopeful now, but perhaps China and the United States could emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic with a renewed understanding that even as they compete, none of the world’s major global challenges can be addressed adequately without cooperation between them.”</p>

    The  growing  popularity  of  the  phrase  'rules-based  order'  has  not always  brought  greater  clarity  as  to  what the order is,  or  what  it  is  supposed  to  do. Australian leaders have deployed the term differently in response to divergent challenges.

    This  digital  feature  illustrates,  chronologically  and  thematically,  how  Australian governments have adopted and deployed the concept of the rules-based order.  From Prime Minister Kevin  Rudd's  2008  speech  to  the  Brookings  Institution  in Washington  DC,  through  to  Prime  Minister  Scott  Morrison's  virtual address at the 2020 Aspen Security Forum, we track how the idea of the rules-based order has been shaped by global events and the changing priorities of the Australian government. We also identify ten recurring propositions about the rules-based order. Along the way, readers will see comments from experts who shaped the national debate and formulated government policy.

    The purpose of this feature is not to develop an argument about the rules-based order, but rather, to provide a better understanding of the concept, and a resource for a more informed debate.<br><br><br>

    # RECURRING PROPOSITIONS ABOUT THE RULES-BASED ORDER:

    ## It is centred on multilateral organisations

    Australian governments have typically defined the rules-based order expansively to encompass “a broad architecture of international governance which has developed since the end of the Second World War”.<cite ref="2"></cite>

    According to Prime Minister Morrison, “The UN is the prime custodian of the rules-based order … the UN and its norms are central to a cooperative rules-based approach to global challenges."<cite ref="3"></cite>

    Foreign Minister Marise Payne has said multilateral organisations “create rules that are vital to Australia’s security, interests, values and prosperity. Those bodies regulate international cooperation in key sectors of our economy including civil aviation, maritime transport, intellectual property, telecommunications, agriculture. They promote universal values and play critical roles in responding to emerging global challenges.”<cite ref="4"></cite>

            “Australia has engaged seriously with international legal institutions, for example, by accepting the optional jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (which just over a third of United Nations members have done). However, in 2002 we changed our declaration to preclude the ICJ hearing any disputes relating to maritime boundaries. Government officials acknowledged at the time that this was done to prevent Timor-Leste bringing a case.”
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    ## It reflects our values

    Prime Minister Julia Gillard said “The values of the [United Nations] Charter don’t only reflect the official stance of the Australian government. They reflect the character of the Australian people.”<cite ref="5"></cite>

    More recently, and in response to growing pressure on the rules-based order, Foreign Minister Payne said Australia “must stand up for our values and bring our influence to bear in these institutions to protect and promote our national interests, and to preserve the open character of international institutions based on universal values and transparency”.<cite ref="4"></cite>

        <div class="content">
          <p>“The essence of a rules-based order is countering the risk of abuse of power. Australia's support for a rules-based international order assumes, however, that it applies externally with little apparent reflection on how such a policy might apply at home. Take, for example, Australia's expansion of executive discretion and its reduction of the accountability of the executive to judicial oversight in areas such as migration and national security. The fact that criminal trials can be heard in secret, as in the current prosecution of lawyer Bernard Collaery, is at odds with Australia's international support for the rule of law, including the right to a fair trial, open justice, and press freedom.</p>
          <p>We can observe an overreach of power within the executive branch of Australian government, a declining willingness of parliaments to defend core freedoms, and the exclusion of judges from interpreting laws according to common law principles or the presumption that parliament intends to comply with international law.”</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    ## It has delivered 70 years of peace and prosperity

    According to the 2016 Defence White Paper, the rules-based order “has helped support Australia’s security and economic interests for 70 years” because it “supports the peaceful resolution of disputes, facilitates free and open trade and enables unfettered access to the global commons” including “trading routes, secure communications and transport".<cite ref="2"></cite>

    Official statements also credit the rules-based order with limiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. For instance, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Iran nuclear deal “serves our interests in nuclear non-proliferation and in reinforcing the rules-based international system".<cite ref="6"></cite>


    ## It constrains power

    Australian leaders have regularly argued that the rules-based order limits coercion and the abuse of power. In this account, by preventing the “misuse of power”,<cite ref="2"></cite> the rules-based order provides an alternative to a world in which “might is right”.<cite ref="7"></cite>

    The rules-based order is also described as bounding strategic competition so that it can take place “within the framework of international law — not winning through corruption, interference or coercion”.<cite ref="9"></cite>

    It has also enabled “disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means”.<cite ref="10"></cite>

    But government documents sometimes described the rules-based order in less ambitious terms. It “fosters cooperation” and “eases tension between states”.<cite ref="14"></cite> Moreover, the rules are sometimes characterised as only one “component of the international order”.<cite ref="11"></cite>

    <h2 id="us-dependent">It is US dependent</h2>

    Although the rules-based order is seen as a constraint on power, Australian political leaders have consistently emphasised that the order is also dependent on US power. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull referred to a “system of rules and institutions which the United States and its allies built from the ashes of World War II.”<cite ref="23"></cite>

    According to the 2013 National Security Strategy, the United States “provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today”.<cite ref="24"></cite> Similarly, “[t]he global strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order on which Australia relies for our security and prosperity”.<cite ref="2"></cite>

    More recently, Australian policymakers have sought to remind Washington that “the United States’ engagement to support a rules-based order is in its own interests and in the interests of wider international stability and prosperity”.<cite ref="11"></cite>

    Prime Minister Turnbull told an American audience in 2016 that the United States should not “lose sight of the wood for the trees … because the big picture is the rules-based international order, which America has underwritten for generations”.<cite ref="12"></cite>

      </div>
    </div>

    ## It could shape China's rise

    The rise of China looms large, but not always clearly, in Australian policy pronouncements on the rules-based order. In 2008, Prime Minister Rudd urged China to act “in accordance with the rules” and “make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order”.<cite ref="15"></cite>

    After Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Australian federal parliament in 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, “I have never heard a Chinese leader commit so explicitly to a rule-based international order founded on the principle that we should all treat others as we would be treated ourselves.”.<cite ref="16"></cite>

    Prime Minister Turnbull told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang that “Australia and China have both benefited immeasurably from the stability in our region that has been underpinned by the rules-based international order.”<cite ref="17"></cite>

            <p>“[Use of 'rules-based order' in government language] is not in response to the rise of China as such. Rather it is in response to the actions of countries such as China and Russia, among others. China's rise has been welcomed by many nations over many years, and numerous US administrations have engaged with China and urged its government to be a constructive member of the international community. That means China accepting its responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council to uphold international peace and security, which I would argue means supporting the rules-based order.”</p>

        </div>
      </div>

    </div>


    ## It is global and regional

    Government documents have shifted back and forth between emphasising the ‘global’ rules-based order and focusing more tightly on its regional dimension.

    According to the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, “[t]o support a balance in the Indo–Pacific favourable to our interests and promote an open, inclusive and rules-based region, Australia will also work more closely with the region’s major democracies, bilaterally and in small groupings”.<cite ref="11"></cite>

    In the 2016 Defence White Paper, the rules-based order was identified as a central component of Australia’s relationships with the United Nations, NATO, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. India was identified both as an important supporter of the rules-based order and, like China, a major power that can rise peacefully within that framework. Meanwhile, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Tonga had “demonstrated a willingness to make important contributions to maintaining the rules-based global order”. However, when it came to relations with Malaysia and Singapore, the White Paper said Australia was interested in a “rules-based regional order”.<cite ref="2"></cite>

    ## It is under unprecedented pressure

    A growing theme of Australian government statements about the rules-based order over the last decade has been its fragility.

    “Significant forces of change are now buffeting this system”, according to the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper.<cite ref="11"></cite> The 2016 Defence White Paper said the rules-based order was being challenged by “competition between countries and major powers trying to promote their interests outside of the established rules”.<cite ref="2"></cite>

    The 2020 Defence Strategic Update said “confidence in the rules-based global order is being undermined by disruptions from a widening range of sources”.<cite ref="21"></cite>

    ## It needs to evolve

    Canberra often recognises that evolution of the rules-based order is necessary to reflect shifting geopolitics and new dimensions of international relations.

    In 2012, Prime Minister Gillard called for “a greater role for Asian countries”<cite ref="18"></cite>, and the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper said “Australia will support reforms that give new and emerging powers a greater role in the international system. Some change to institutions and patterns of global cooperation is inevitable, necessary and appropriate to reflect the greater weight of countries such as China, Indonesia, India, Nigeria and Brazil. Reform should be a shared project. Australia is a willing partner.”<cite ref="11"></cite>

    More recently, Foreign Minister Payne said that Australia “will work to ensure that the development of new rules and norms to address emerging challenges is consistent with enduring values and principles. This is particularly important in the case of critical technologies, including cyber and artificial intelligence, critical minerals and outer space”.<cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## It requires tangible deeds

    Tangible Australian support for the rules-based order, perhaps extending to military commitments, is addressed in a range of speeches and policy documents. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds has pointed out that standing up for the rules-based order requires “not just words”.<cite ref="13"></cite>

    The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper asserted that “Australia’s interests are strongly served by acting with others to support a rules-based international order. Australia will encourage and tangibly support the leadership of the United States to this end.”<cite ref="11"></cite>

    Australian government rhetoric on military defence of the rules-based order has shifted over the last decade.

    The 2009 Defence White Paper said that in some circumstances, the need to support the rules-based order could see Australia intervene militarily in another country.<cite ref="20"></cite> In the 2016 Defence White Paper, support for the rules-based order was identified as something Australia had fought for before and may be prepared to fight for again.<cite ref="2"></cite>

    In the 2016 White Paper, providing “meaningful contributions to global responses to address threats to the rules-based global order which threaten Australia and its interests”<cite ref="2"></cite> is identified as one of three equally weighted defence objectives. In the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, these three priorities are ordered hierarchically. Australia’s immediate region was listed as the top priority, while “Operations in support of the rules-based global order” was listed as the third priority.<cite ref="22"></cite>
