    ## Trump's fury

    On 20 July 2017, US President Donald Trump's senior advisers attempted an ambush. It backfired spectacularly.

    According to Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, authors of _A Very Stable Genius: Donald J Trump's Testing of America_, Trump's Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and Director of the Economic Council Gary Cohn were concerned about the "gaping holes in the president's knowledge of history and of the alliances forged in the wake of World War II that served as the foundation of America's strength in the world", and they wanted to set him right.

    Mattis began a briefing - ostensibly about Afghanistan - with a slide which read "The post-war international rules-based order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation."

    Trump's adviser Steve Bannon reportedly recalled: "If you stood up and threatened to shoot [Trump], he couldn't say 'post-war rules-based international order'. It's just not the way he thinks." Bannon knew his man. Soon, Trump was flying into a rage against NATO, free trade agreements and the Iran nuclear deal.

    ## Newer than you think

    This anecdote illustrates the growing gulf between foreign policy elites and populist leaders, as well their supporters. Trump's ignorance is not surprising. The concept of the rules-based order is not widely understood outside the corridors of power and academia. But establishment figures like Mattis, Tillerson and Cohn attach increasing importance to it.

    Indeed, the phrase "rules-based order" is relatively young and only after the Cold War ended did it come into use as a descriptor for the post-second World War world. The term "liberal international order" has a much longer history.

    ## Trending in Australia

    The term "liberal international order" has never been popular in Australia but, over the last decade or so, the Australian government has avidly adopted the concept of a "rules-based international order".

    This may just be a new way of describing a longstanding policy – former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop refers to the increasing use of the term as a "semantic innovation". In his book _Fear of Abandonment_, Allan Gyngell argues that all Australian governments have based their foreign policies on the US alliance, regional engagement, and efforts to "support and try to influence, in its own interests, the organisations, rules and norms – the generally accepted standards of behaviour that most states apply to themselves and others – which together made up a rules-based international order".

    Executive Director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, Richard Maude, says Australian policy makers have had a consistent, if perhaps too often implicit, understanding of what the RBO means and why it is important:

    > First, global order is shaped primarily by the power of sovereign states. Second, in the decades following the Second World War, a system of multilateral policy making, and rule-setting institutions was created, alongside the development of international law. This is the rules-based order (or, as we preferred in the old Office of National Assessments, the rules-based component of global order). Third, to the extent this system can promote global responses to global challenges and protect Australia from coercive power, it serves our interests. Fourth, the liberal dimensions of the order reflect Australian values and interests and should be protected wherever possible.

    Recent Australian support for the RBO has been unusually bipartisan and continuous - despite frequent changes in Prime Minister. Old divisions about the extent to which Australia should look to the US or UN have largely disappeared.

    Our examination of the past decade suggests that this bipartisanship reflects the challenges Australia faces from the major geopolitical shifts in this period: the rise of an assertive China, a more disruptive US, and increasingly competitive state behaviour – including in new domains like cyber and space.

    However, the growing popularity of the phrase "rules-based order" hasn't always brought greater clarity as to what it is or what it is supposed to do. Australian leaders have deployed the RBO in different ways in response to different challenges.

    This feature tries to shed more light on Australia's use of the RBO concept, by providing a short history of the recent evolution of the term – organised by Prime Minister – and by identifying its many meanings.

    # The rules-based order ...

    ## ... is centred on multilateral organisations

    Australian governments have typically defined the RBO expansively to encompass the economic and security orders that are centred on "a broad architecture of international governance which has developed since the end of the Second World War". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    According to Prime Minister Scott Morrison in 2019, "The UN is the prime custodian of the rules-based order ... the UN and its norms are central to a cooperative rules-based approach to global challenges." <cite ref="3"></cite>

    In a June 2020 speech at the ANU National Security College, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said multilateral organisations "create rules that are vital to Australia's security, interests, values and prosperity. Those bodies regulate international cooperation in key sectors of our economy including civil aviation, maritime transport, intellectual property, telecommunications, agriculture. They promote universal values and play critical roles in responding to emerging global challenges." <cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## ... reflects our values

    In 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said "The values of the (UN) Charter don't only reflect the official stance of the Australian Government. They reflect the character of the Australian people." <cite ref="5"></cite>

    But it can't be assumed that this will continue indefinitely. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in 2020 that "We must stand up for our values and bring our influence to bear in these institutions to protect and promote our national interests, and to preserve the open character of international institutions based on universal values and transparency." <cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## ... has delivered 70 years of peace and prosperity

    The RBO is frequently credited with having averted major war. It "has helped support Australia's security and economic interests for 70 years" because it "supports the peaceful resolution of disputes, facilitates free and open trade and enables unfettered access to the global commons" including "trading routes, secure communications and transport". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    The RBO has limited the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. For instance, as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in 2017 of the Iran nuclear agreement, Australia's support for the deal "serves our interests in nuclear non-proliferation and in reinforcing the rules-based international system". <cite ref="6"></cite>

    The RBO is rarely cited as supporting counter-terrorism, except insofar as it enables international cooperation.

    ## ... constrains power

    Australia leaders have regularly argued that the RBO places limits on coercion and the abuse of power. By preventing the misuse of power, the RBO provides an alternative to a world in which "might is right". <cite ref="7"></cite>

    The RBO "bounds strategic competition" so that competition can take place "within the framework of international law - not winning through corruption, interference or coercion". <cite ref="9"></cite>

    It also enables "disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means". <cite ref="10"></cite>

    But the RBO's role is also described in less ambitious terms. It "fosters cooperation" and "eases tension between states". Moreover, the rules are sometimes just a "component of the international order". <cite ref="11"></cite>

    ## US dependent <cite class="bishop" tooltip="The rules-based order is not designed to ensure US dominance, although as the initiator and guarantor, it has largely submitted to that order. Many nations have challenged the US through the mechanisms of that order on for example, trade and economic matters, and won. The general assumption within the US system, pre-Trump, has been that a strong and peaceful world is beneficial to all nations, including the US."></cite> <cite class="maude" tooltip="Australia didn't have to think too hard about the rules-based component of global order while US power was unchallenged and America was the dominant influence on rules and norms. Even though the United States was sometimes a reluctant multilateralist and reserved the right to exercise power unilaterally, this period was mostly one of a comfortable convergence between Australian interests and values."></cite>

    Although the RBO constrains power, Australian political leaders have also consistently argued that it is dependent on US power. The "US anchored rules-based order" was "built" by "the United States and its allies", according to Malcolm Turnbull in 2017. <cite ref="9"></cite>

    The 2016 Defence White Paper says United States "provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today." The "strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    More recently, Australian policy makers have sought to remind Washington that "the United States' engagement to support a rules-based order is in its own interests and in the interests of wider international stability and prosperity". <cite ref="11"></cite>

    The United States should not "lose sight of the wood for the trees … because the big picture is: the rules-based international order, which America has underwritten for generations." <cite ref="12"></cite>

    "Australia does not take for granted a regional default inclination towards the advantages of existing rules-based systems – nor should the United States". <cite ref="13"></cite>

    ## Shaping China <cite class="maude" tooltip="A more powerful, nationalist and authoritarian China under President Xi Jinping required Australia to think harder about how to defend and promote rules that supported regional and international security and economic integration. Rules and norms became more important to Australia and simultaneously harder to get agreement on and enforce."></cite><cite class="bishop" tooltip="[Use of ‘rules-based order’ in government rhetoric] is in response to the actions of countries such as China and Russia…China’s rise has been welcomed by many nations … US administrations have engaged with China and urged it to be a constructive member of the international community. That means accepting its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UNSC … which I would argue means supporting the rules-based order."></cite>

    The rise of China looms large – but not always clearly – in Australian policy pronouncements on the RBO. In 2008 Prime Minister Rudd urged China to act "in accordance with the rules" and "make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order." <cite ref="15"></cite>

    When Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Australian parliament in 2014, Prime Minister Abbott heard him "commit … explicitly to a rule-based international order founded on the principle that we should all treat others as we would be treated ourselves." <cite ref="16"></cite>

    Prime Minister Turnbull reminded Chinese Premier Li Keqiang that "Australia and China have both benefited immeasurably from the stability in our region that has been underpinned by the rules-based international order." <cite ref="17"></cite>

    ## Friends in the region and around the globe

    Australia's support for the RBO is not all about the United States and China. Australia supports a "global" RBO but also highlights the regional dimension. "To support a balance in the Indo–Pacific favourable to our interests and promote an open, inclusive and rules-based region, Australia will also work more closely with the region's major democracies, bilaterally and in small groupings". <cite ref="11"></cite>

    The RBO is identified as a central component of Australia's relationships with the United Nations, NATO, the UK, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand. India is identified both as an important supporter of the RBO and – like China – a major power that the RBO can assist to rise peacefully. Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga have "demonstrated a willingness to make important contributions to maintaining the rules-based global order". But when it comes to Malaysia and Singapore, Australia is interested in a more focused "regional rules-based order". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    ## Under unprecedented pressure

    A consistent theme of Australian government statements about the RBO over the last decade has been the fragility of the order. "Significant forces of change are now buffeting this system", according to the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. <cite ref="11"></cite> The RBO is challenged by "competition between countries and major powers trying to promote their interests outside of the established rules." <cite ref="2"></cite>

    The 2020 Defence Strategic Update says "confidence in the rules-based global order is being undermined by disruptions from a widening range of sources. <cite ref="21"></cite>

    ## Saving and evolving

    Canberra recognises that evolution of the RBO is necessary to reflect shifting geopolitics and new dimensions of international relations.

    In 2012, Prime Minister Gillard called for "a greater role for Asian powers", <cite ref="18"></cite> and the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper said "Australia will support reforms that give new and emerging powers a greater role in the international system. Some change to institutions and patterns of global cooperation is inevitable, necessary and appropriate to reflect the greater weight of countries such as China, Indonesia, India, Nigeria and Brazil. Reform should be a shared project. Australia is a willing partner." <cite ref="11"></cite>

    Australia will "will work to ensure that the development of new rules and norms to address emerging challenges is consistent with enduring values and principles. This is particularly important in the case of critical technologies, including cyber and artificial intelligence, critical minerals and outer space", according to Foreign Minister Marise Payne in 2020. <cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## Tangible deeds

    Standing up for the RBO requires "not just words"<cite ref="13"></cite> but "tangible deeds". <cite ref="11"></cite> Support for the RBO is identified as something Australia has fought for before and may be prepared to fight for again. <cite ref="2"></cite>

    Yet Australian government rhetoric on making tangible military commitments to the RBO has evolved over the last decade. The 2009 Defence White Paper says that in some circumstances, support for the RBO could see Australia intervene militarily in another country in order to meet the "responsibility to protect.". <cite ref="20"></cite>The 2016 Defence White Paper lists three equally weighted defence objectives, with the third being "to provide meaningful contributions to global responses to address threats to the rules-based global order which threaten Australia and its interests". <cite ref="2"></cite> In the 2020 Strategic Update, these three equal priorities had become a hierarchy. As Prime Minister Morrison said at the launch, "The objectives outlined in the 2016 Defence White Paper saw an equal weighting across the three areas of Australia and its northern approach, South-East Asia and the Pacific and operations in support of the rules-based global order. In this update, the Government has directed Defence to prioritise…ADF's geographical focus on our immediate region…" <cite ref="22"></cite>
