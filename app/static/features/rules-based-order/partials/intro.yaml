    ## Trump's fury

    On 20 July 2017, US President Donald Trump's senior advisers attempted an ambush. It backfired spectacularly.

    According to Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, authors of _A Very Stable Genius: Donald J Trump's Testing of America_, Trump's Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn were concerned about the "gaping holes in the president's knowledge of history and the alliances forged in the wake of World War II", and they wanted to set him right.

    Mattis began a briefing, ostensibly about Afghanistan, with a slide that read "The post-war international rules-based order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation."

    Trump's adviser Steve Bannon reportedly recalled: "If you stood up and threatened to shoot [Trump], he couldn't say 'post-war rules-based international order'. It's just not the way he thinks." Bannon knew his man. Soon, President Trump was flying into a rage against NATO, free trade agreements, and the Iran nuclear deal.

    ## Newer than you think

    This anecdote illustrates the growing gulf between foreign policy elites and populist leaders, as well as their supporters. President Trump's ignorance is not surprising. The concept of the rules-based order is not widely understood outside the corridors of power and academia. But establishment figures like Mattis, Tillerson, and Cohn attach increasing importance to it.

    The phrase 'rules-based order', also referred to as RBO, is relatively young and only after the Cold War ended did it come into use as a descriptor for the post-Second World War era. The term 'liberal international order' has a much longer history.

    ## Trending in Australia

    The term 'liberal international order' has never been popular in Australia but, over the last decade or so, the Australian Government has avidly adopted the concept of a 'rules-based international order'.

    This may just be a new way of describing a longstanding policy. Former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop agrees that the term is a 'semantic innovation'. Allan Gyngell, in his book _Fear of Abandonment_, argues that all Australian governments have based their foreign policies on the US alliance, regional engagement, and efforts to "support and try to influence … the organisations, rules and norms – the generally accepted standards of behaviour that most states apply to themselves and others – which together [make] up a rules-based international order".

    Richard Maude, former Director-General of the Office of National Assessments, says Australian policymakers have had a consistent, if perhaps too often implicit, understanding of what the RBO means and why it is important:

    > First, global order is shaped primarily by the power of sovereign states. Second, in the decades following the Second World War, a system of multilateral policymaking, and rule-setting institutions was created, alongside the development of international law. This is the rules-based order. Third, to the extent this system can promote global responses to global challenges and protect Australia from coercive power, it serves our interests. Fourth, the liberal dimensions of the order reflect Australian values and interests and should be protected wherever possible.

    According to Hilary Charlesworth, Melbourne Laureate Professor at the Melbourne Law School:

    > Australia's aspirations to 'good international citizenship' have waxed and waned in practice. Canberra's attitude to international law and institutions might be best described as ambivalent. Certainly, Australia has not demonstrated the hostility towards international legal institutions manifested in particular contexts by the superpowers.

    And in the words of Rory Medcalf, Head of the National Security College, ANU:

    > It is striking that advocacy of a rules-based international order has been a broadly consistent thread of Australian foreign policy across five prime ministers and both sides of politics over the past 12 years. That advocacy tended to intensify as the rules-based system came under increasing strain, although has been pragmatically tempered somewhat in 2020 when the world entered a phase of starkly worsening disorder and disruption: note the extensive reference to the rules-based order in Australia's 2016 Defence White Paper, but the greater focus on power and deterrence in the 2020 Defence Strategic Update.<br style="margin-top: 1em; display: block; content: '';" />This pragmatism is not unique to the COVID-and-after era — indeed from Rudd onwards, Australian leaders were always conscious that the reality was a 'rules-and-power-based order', and we needed to be able to operate in both.

    Our examination of the past decade suggests that the bipartisan continuity noted by Rory is a reaction to the major geopolitical shifts in this period: the rise of an assertive China, a more disruptive United States, and increasingly competitive state behaviour, including in new domains such as cyber and space.

    However, the growing popularity of the phrase 'rules-based order' has not always brought greater clarity as to what it is, or what it is supposed to do. Australian leaders have deployed the RBO in different ways in response to different challenges.

    Below, we present thematic and chronological accounts of the 'rules-based order' concept in Australian security and foreign policy, highlighting key ideas and moments of evolution. Starting with Kevin Rudd's 2008 address to The Brookings Institution in Washington DC, and extending to the current prime minister, Scott Morrison, we track how the idea has been shaped by each government and examine significant global events that influenced its development. We also explore ten key themes that emerge again and again through which Australian governments have promoted the concept since 2008. Along the way, you will see comments from experts who shaped the national debate and made government policy.<br><br>

    # The rules-based order ...

    ## Is centred on multilateral organisations<cite class="charlesworth" tooltip="Australia has engaged seriously with international legal institutions, for example, by accepting the optional jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (which just over a third of UN members have done). However, in 2002 we changed our declaration to preclude the ICJ hearing any disputes relating to maritime boundaries. Government officials acknowledged at the time that this was done to prevent Timor-Leste bringing a case."></cite>

    Australian governments have typically defined the RBO expansively to encompass the economic and security orders that are centred on "a broad architecture of international governance which has developed since the end of the Second World War".<cite ref="2"></cite>

    According to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, "The UN is the prime custodian of the rules-based order ... the UN and its norms are central to a cooperative rules-based approach to global challenges."<cite ref="3"></cite>

    Foreign Minister Marise Payne said multilateral organisations "create rules that are vital to Australia's security, interests, values and prosperity. Those bodies regulate international cooperation in key sectors of our economy including civil aviation, maritime transport, intellectual property, telecommunications, agriculture. They promote universal values and play critical roles in responding to emerging global challenges."<cite ref="4"></cite>


    ## Reflects our values

    Prime Minister Julia Gillard said "The values of the [United Nations] Charter don't only reflect the official stance of the Australian Government. They reflect the character of the Australian people."<cite ref="5"></cite>

    But it cannot be assumed that the values of the international system are unchanging. China wants multilateral organisations to reflect its values. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia "must stand up for our values and bring our influence to bear in these institutions to protect and promote our national interests, and to preserve the open character of international institutions based on universal values and transparency".<cite ref="4"></cite>

          <p>The essence of a rules-based order is countering the risk of abuse of power. Australia's support for a rules-based international order assumes, however, that it applies externally with little apparent reflection on how such a policy might apply at home. Take, for example, Australia's expansion of executive discretion and its reduction of the accountability of the executive to judicial oversight in areas such as migration and national security. The fact that criminal trials can be heard in secret, as in the current prosecution of lawyer Bernard Collaery, is at odds with Australia's international support for the rule of law, including the right to a fair trial, open justice, and press freedom.</p>
          <p>We can observe an overreach of power within the executive branch of Australian government, a declining willingness of parliaments to defend core freedoms, and the exclusion of judges from interpreting laws according to common law principles or the presumption that parliament intends to comply with international law.</p>

    ## Has delivered 70 years of peace and prosperity

    The RBO is frequently credited with having averted major war. It "has helped support Australia's security and economic interests for 70 years" because it "supports the peaceful resolution of disputes, facilitates free and open trade and enables unfettered access to the global commons" including "trading routes, secure communications and transport".<cite ref="2"></cite>

    The RBO has limited the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. For instance, as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said of the Iran nuclear agreement, Australia's support for the deal "serves our interests in nuclear non-proliferation and in reinforcing the rules-based international system".<cite ref="6"></cite>

    The RBO is rarely cited as supporting counter-terrorism, except insofar as it enables international cooperation.


    ## Constrains power

    Australian leaders have regularly argued that the RBO places limits on coercion and the abuse of power. By preventing the "misuse of power",<cite ref="2"></cite> the RBO provides an alternative to a world in which "might is right".<cite ref="7"></cite>

    The RBO bounds strategic competition so that it can take place "within the framework of international law — not winning through corruption, interference or coercion".<cite ref="9"></cite>

    It also enables "disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means".<cite ref="10"></cite>

    But the RBO's role is also described in less ambitious terms. It "fosters cooperation" and "eases tension between states".<cite ref="14"></cite> Moreover, the rules are sometimes just a "component of the international order".<cite ref="11"></cite>

    ## Is US dependent<cite class="bishop" tooltip="The rules-based order is not designed to ensure US dominance, although as the initiator and guarantor, it has largely submitted to that order. Many nations have challenged the United States through the mechanisms of that order on, for example, trade and economic matters, and won. The general assumption within the US system, pre-Trump, has been that a strong and peaceful world is beneficial to all nations, including the United States."></cite><cite class="maude" tooltip="Australia did not have to think too hard about the rules-based component of global order while US power was unchallenged and America was the dominant influence on rules and norms. Even though the United States was sometimes a reluctant multilateralist and reserved the right to exercise power unilaterally, this period was mostly one of a comfortable convergence between Australian interests and values."></cite>

    Although the RBO constrains power, Australian political leaders have consistently argued that it is dependent on US power. The "US anchored rules-based order"<cite ref="9"></cite> was "built from the ashes of World War II".<cite ref="23"></cite>

    The 2016 Defence White Paper says the United States "provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today."<cite ref="24"></cite> The "The global strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order on which Australia relies for our security and prosperity".<cite ref="2"></cite>

    More recently, Australian policymakers have sought to remind Washington that "the United States' engagement to support a rules-based order is in its own interests and in the interests of wider international stability and prosperity".<cite ref="11"></cite>

    The United States should not "lose sight of the wood for the trees … because the big picture is the rules-based international order, which America has underwritten for generations".<cite ref="12"></cite>

    ## Could shape China's rise<cite class="maude" tooltip="A more powerful, nationalist, and authoritarian China under President Xi Jinping required Australia to think harder about how to defend and promote rules that supported regional and international security and economic integration. Rules and norms became more important to Australia and simultaneously harder to get agreement on and enforce."></cite><cite class="bishop" tooltip="[Use of 'rules-based order' in government language] is not in response to the rise of China as such. Rather it is in response to the actions of countries such as China and Russia, among others. China's rise has been welcomed by many nations over many years, and numerous US administrations have engaged with China and urged its government to be a constructive member of the international community. That means China accepting its responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to uphold international peace and security, which I would argue means supporting the rules-based order."></cite>

    The rise of China looms large, but not always clearly, in Australian policy pronouncements on the RBO. In 2008, Prime Minister Rudd urged China to act "in accordance with the rules" and "make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order".<cite ref="15"></cite>

    When Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Australian parliament in 2014, Prime Minister Abbott heard him "commit … explicitly to a rule-based international order founded on the principle that we should all treat others as we would be treated ourselves".<cite ref="16"></cite>

    Prime Minister Turnbull reminded Chinese Premier Li Keqiang that "Australia and China have both benefited immeasurably from the stability in our region that has been underpinned by the rules-based international order."<cite ref="17"></cite>

    ## Is global and regional

    Government documents have shifted back and forth between emphasising the "global" rules-based order and focusing more tightly on its regional dimension. "To support a balance in the Indo–Pacific favourable to our interests and promote an open, inclusive and rules-based region, Australia will also work more closely with the region's major democracies, bilaterally and in small groupings".<cite ref="11"></cite>

    In the 2016 Defence White Paper, the RBO is identified as a central component of Australia's relationships with the United Nations, NATO, the UK, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. India is identified both as an important supporter of the RBO and, like China, a major power that can rise peacefully within the framework of the RBO. Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Tonga have "demonstrated a willingness to make important contributions to maintaining the rules-based global order". But when it comes to Malaysia and Singapore, Australia is interested in a more focused "rules-based regional order".<cite ref="2"></cite>

    ## Is under unprecedented pressure

    A growing theme of Australian government statements about the RBO over the last decade has been its fragility. "Significant forces of change are now buffeting this system".<cite ref="11"></cite> The RBO is challenged by "competition between countries and major powers trying to promote their interests outside of the established rules".<cite ref="2"></cite>

    The 2020 Defence Strategic Update says "Confidence in the rules-based global order is being undermined by disruptions from a widening range of sources."<cite ref="21"></cite>

    ## Needs to evolve

    Canberra recognises that evolution of the RBO is necessary to reflect shifting geopolitics and new dimensions of international relations.

    In 2012, Prime Minister Gillard called for "a greater role for Asian countries"<cite ref="18"></cite>, and the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper said "Australia will support reforms that give new and emerging powers a greater role in the international system. Some change to institutions and patterns of global cooperation is inevitable, necessary and appropriate to reflect the greater weight of countries such as China, Indonesia, India, Nigeria and Brazil. Reform should be a shared project. Australia is a willing partner."<cite ref="11"></cite>

    Australia "will work to ensure that the development of new rules and norms to address emerging challenges is consistent with enduring values and principles. This is particularly important in the case of critical technologies, including cyber and artificial intelligence, critical minerals and outer space", according to Foreign Minister Marise Payne.<cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## Requires tangible deeds

    Standing up for the RBO requires "not just words",<cite ref="13"></cite> but deeds. "Australia's interests are strongly served by acting with others to support a rules-based international order. Australia will encourage and tangibly support the leadership of the United States to this end."<cite ref="11"></cite> Support for the RBO is identified as something Australia has fought for before and may be prepared to fight for again.<cite ref="2"></cite>

    Yet Australian government rhetoric on military defence of the RBO has evolved over the last decade. The 2009 Defence White Paper says that in some circumstances, support for the RBO could see Australia intervene militarily in another country in order to meet the "responsibility to protect"<cite ref="20"></cite>.The 2016 Defence White Paper lists three equally weighted defence objectives, with the third being "to provide meaningful contributions to global responses to address threats to the rules-based global order which threaten Australia and its interests".<cite ref="2"></cite> In the 2020 Strategic Update, these three equal priorities have become a hierarchy. Australia's immediate region is the top priority, and "Operations in support of the rules-based global order" became the third priority.<cite ref="22"></cite>
