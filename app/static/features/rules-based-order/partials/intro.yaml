    ## Trump&#39;s fury

    On 20 July 2017, US President Donald Trump&#39;s senior advisers attempted an ambush. It was a move that backfired spectacularly.

    According to Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, authors of _A Very Stable Genius: Donald J Trump&#39;s Testing of America_, Trump&#39;s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and Director of the Economic Council Gary Cohn were concerned about the "gaping holes in the president&#39;s knowledge of history and of the alliances forged in the wake of World War II that served as the foundation of America&#39;s strength in the world", and they wanted to set him right.

    Mattis began a briefing - ostensibly about Afghanistan - with a slide which read "The post-war international rules-based order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation."

    Trump&#39;s adviser Steve Bannon reportedly recalled: "If you stood up and threatened to shoot [Trump], he couldn&#39;t say &#39;post-war rules-based international order&#39;. It&#39;s just not the way he thinks." Bannon knew his man. Soon, Trump was flying into a rage against NATO, free trade agreements and the Iran nuclear deal.

    ## Newer than you think <cite class="bishop" tooltip="[Increasing use of the term &#39;rules-based order&#39; in government messaging] is a semantic innovation, in that Australia has been a primary participant of the order&#39;s development and one of its strongest defenders. Our actions over many years have demonstrated that, and I do not believe that articulating it in this way has changed our engagement with the order."><cite>

    This anecdote illustrates the growing gulf between foreign policy elites and populist leaders – as well their supporters. Trump&#39;s ignorance is not completely surprising. The concept of the rules-based order is not widely understood outside the corridors of power and academia. But establishment figures like Mattis, Tillerson and Cohn attach increasing importance to it.

    So surprising that the specific phrase "rules-based order" (RBO) is relatively young. Only after the Cold War had ended did it come into use as a descriptor for the post-second World War world The term "liberal international order" has a much longer history.

    ## Trending in Australia

    The term "liberal international order" has never been popular in Australia but, over the last decade or so, the Australian government has avidly adopted the concept of a "rules-based international order".

    This may just be a new way of describing a longstanding policy. Similar phrases, like "[good international citizenship](http://www.gevans.org/speeches/old/1990/060390_fm_fpandgoodinternationalcitizen.pdf)” have fallen in and out of fashion. <cite ref="1"></cite>In his book _Fear of Abandonment_, Allan Gyngell argues that all Australian governments have based their foreign policies on the US alliance, regional engagement, and efforts to "support and try to influence, in its own interests, the organisations, rules and norms – the generally accepted standards of behaviour that most states apply to themselves and others – which together made up a rules-based international order". <cite class="maude" tooltip="'Rules-based order' is admittedly a wonky and contested term. But Australian policy makers have had a consistent, if perhaps too often implicit, understanding of what it means and why it is important.<br><br>First, global order is shaped primarily by the power of sovereign states.<br><br>Second, in the decades following the Second World War, a system of multilateral policy making and rule-setting institutions was created, alongside the development of international law. This is the rules-based order (or, as we preferred in the old Office of National Assessments, the rules based component of global order).<br><br>Third, to the extent this system can promote global responses to global challenges and protect Australia from coercive power, it serves our interests.<br><br>Fourth, the liberal dimensions of the order reflect Australian values and interests and should be protected wherever possible"></cite>

    Even so, recent Australian support for the RBO has been unusually bipartisan and continuous - despite frequent changes in Prime Minister. Old divisions, about the extent to which Australia should look to the US or to the UN, have all but disappeared.

    Our examination of the past decade suggests that this bipartisanship reflects the challenges Australia faces from the major geopolitical shifts in this period; the rise of an assertive China, a more disruptive US, and increasingly competitive state behaviour – including in new domains like cyber and outerspace. <cite class="maude" tooltip="How to juggle our values with our political, economic and security interests in Asia is the contemporary sharp edge of an old dilemma. Australia cannot afford to make values the primary driver of our engagement with Asia. That would close the space for greater cooperation with partners like Vietnam or even Indonesia. But the liberal character of many global rules and norms - open trade, international law, political and religious freedoms, racial and gender equality and broader human rights - supports Australia&#39;s security and prosperity and reflects who we are as a nation. It has become more important for Australia to assert and defend these values, especially as China has become more authoritarian, more willing to interfere in our domestic affairs and increasingly determined to reshape parts of the global system to legitimise Communist Party rule."></cite>

    However, more references to the rules-based order hasn&#39;t always brought greater clarity as to what it is or what it is supposed to do. Australian leaders have deployed the RBO in different ways in response to different challenges.

    This feature tries to shed more light on Australia&#39;s use of the RBO concept, by providing a short history of the recent evolution of the term – organised by Prime Minister – and by highlighting its main meanings.

    # What the RBO means

    ## UN-centred

    Australian governments have typically defined the RBO expansively to encompass the economic and security orders that are centred on "a broad architecture of international governance which has developed since the end of the Second World War". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    "The UN is the prime custodian of the rules-based order ... the UN and its norms are central to a cooperative rules-based approach to global challenges." <cite ref="3"></cite> It includes "international laws and conventions and regional security architectures." <cite ref="2"></cite> "A rules-based global order means a shared commitment by all countries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules which evolve over time, such as international law and regional security arrangements". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    In her recent speech before the ANU National Security College, Australian Foreign Minister, Marise Payne, said multilateral organisations "create rules that are vital to Australia&#39;s security, interests, values and prosperity. Those bodies regulate international cooperation in key sectors of our economy including civil aviation, maritime transport, intellectual property, telecommunications, agriculture. They promote universal values and play critical roles in responding to emerging global challenges." <cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## Reflecting our values

    "The values of the (UN) Charter don&#39;t only reflect the official stance of the Australian Government They reflect the character of the Australian people." <cite ref="5"></cite>. But it can&#39;t be assumed that this will continue indefinitely. "We must stand up for our values and bring our influence to bear in these institutions to protect and promote our national interests, and to preserve the open character of international institutions based on universal values and transparency." <cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## Delivering 70 years of peace and prosperity

    The RBO is frequently credited with having averted major war. It "has helped support Australia&#39;s security and economic interests for 70 years" because it "supports the peaceful resolution of disputes, facilitates free and open trade and enables unfettered access to the global commons" including "trading routes, secure communications and transport". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    The RBO "serves to deal with threats before they become existential threats to Australia" <cite ref="2"></cite> and has limited the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Australia&#39;s support for the Iran nuclear deal "serves our interests in nuclear non-proliferation and in reinforcing the rules-based international system". <cite ref="6"></cite>

    The RBO is rarely cited as supporting counter-terrorism, except insofar as it enables international cooperation.

    ## Constraining power

    The RBO limits power and coercion. By preventing the "misuse" of power, the RBO provides an alternative to a world in which "might is right" <cite ref="7"></cite><cite ref="8"></cite>

    The RBO "bounds strategic competition" so that competition can take place "within the framework of international law - not winning through corruption, interference or coercion". <cite ref="9"></cite>

    It enables "disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means. <cite ref="10"></cite>

    But the RBO&#39;s role is also described in less ambitious terms. It "fosters cooperation" and "eases tension between states". Moreover, the rules are sometimes just a "component of the international order" <cite ref="11"></cite>

    ## US dependent <cite class="bishop" tooltip="The rules-based order is not designed to ensure US dominance, although as the initiator and guarantor, it has largely submitted to that order. Many nations have challenged the US through the mechanisms of that order on for example, trade and economic matters, and won. The general assumption within the US system, pre-Trump, has been that a strong and peaceful world is beneficial to all nations, including the US."></cite> <cite class="maude" tooltip="Australia didn&#39;t have to think too hard about the rules-based component of global order while US power was unchallenged and America was the dominant influence on rules and norms. Even though the United States was sometimes a reluctant multilateralist and reserved the right to exercise power unilaterally, this period was mostly one of a comfortable convergence between Australian interests and values."></cite>

    Although the RBO constrains power it is also dependent on US power. The "US anchored rules-based order" was "built" by "the United States and its allies". <cite ref="9"></cite>

    The United States "provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today." The "strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order". "Australia&#39;s shared interest with the United States in a stable rules-based global order has seen us operate side by side in every major conflict since the First World War". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    More recently, Australian policy makers have sought to remind Washington that "the United States&#39; engagement to support a rules-based order is in its own interests and in the interests of wider international stability and prosperity". <cite ref="11"></cite>

    The United States should not "lose sight of the wood for the trees … because the big picture is: the rules-based international order, which America has underwritten for generations." <cite ref="12"></cite>

    "Australia does not take for granted a regional default inclination towards the advantages of existing rules-based systems – nor should the United States". <cite ref="13"></cite>

    ## Shaping China <cite class="maude" tooltip=" A more powerful, nationalist and authoritarian China under President Xi Jinping required Australia to think harder about how to defend and promote rules that supported regional and international security and economic integration. Rules and norms became more important to Australia and simultaneously harder to get agreement on and enforce."></cite><cite class="bishop" tooltip="[Use of &#39;rules-based order&#39; in government rhetoric] is not in response to the rise of China as such. Rather it is in response to the actions of countries such as China and Russia, among others. China&#39;s rise has been welcomed by many nations over many years and numerous US administrations have engaged with China and urged its government to be a constructive member of the international community. That means accepting its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UNSC to uphold international peace and security, which I would argue means supporting the rules-based order. "></cite>

    The rise of China looms large – but not always clearly – in Australian policy pronouncements on the RBO. A stable RBO means that "no hostile power in the Indo-Pacific is able to coerce or intimidate others through force or the threat of force." China should support the RBO because the RBO enabled Chin&#39;s rise. Australia supports an RBO that "provide incentives" for China (and India) to "rise peacefully". <cite ref="14"></cite>

    Prime Minister Rudd urged China to act "in accordance with the rules" and "make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order." <cite ref="15"></cite>

    Prime Minister Abbott heard Chinese President Xi Jinping "commit … explicitly to a rule-based international order founded on the principle that we should all treat others as we would be treated ourselves." <cite ref="16"></cite>

    Prime Minister Turnbull reminded Premier Li that "Australia and China have both benefited immeasurably from the stability in our region that has been underpinned by the rules-based international order." <cite ref="17"></cite>

    ## Friends and allies

    It&#39;s not all about the United States and China. Australia supports a "global" RBO but often highlights the regional dimension. "To support a balance in the Indo–Pacific favourable to our interests and promote an open, inclusive and rules-based region, Australia will also work more closely with the region&#39;s major democracies, bilaterally and in small groupings". <cite ref="11"></cite>

    The RBO is identified as a central component of Australia&#39;s relationships with the United Nations, NATO, the UK, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand. India is identified both as an important supporter of the RBO and – like China – a major power that the RBO can encourage to rise peacefully. Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga have "demonstrated a willingness to make important contributions to maintaining the rules-based global order". But when it comes to Malaysia and Singapore, Australia is interested in a more focussed "regional rules-based order". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    ## Under unprecedented pressure

    "The framework of the rules-based global order is under increasing pressure and has shown signs of fragility". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    "Significant forces of change are now buffeting this system." <cite ref="11"></cite>

    The RBO is challenged by "competition between countries and major powers trying to promote their interests outside of the established rules." <cite ref="2"></cite>

    "In some cases, major powers are ignoring or undermining international law". <cite ref="11"></cite>

    "Some countries and non-state actors have sought to challenge the rules that govern actions in the global commons of the high seas, cyberspace and space in unhelpful ways, leading to uncertainty and tension". <cite ref="2"></cite>

    "The pandemic has brought into stark relief the major role of international institutions in addressing and coordinating a global response to a global problem … The COVID-19 experience reflects a much wider issue. Our multilateral institutions are experiencing unprecedented strain from a new era of strategic competition. From shifts in global power, from technological disruption and complex security, health and economic challenges." <cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## Saving and evolving

    In the face of these challenges Australia seeks to "preserve the rules-based structure" that has "enabled" the "dynamism of the region". <cite ref="9"></cite>

    But Canberra also recognises that "evolution" of the international system is necessary to reflect shifting geopolitics and new dimensions of international relations.

    "Australia will support reforms that give new and emerging powers a greater role in the international system. Some change to institutions and patterns of global cooperation is inevitable, necessary and appropriate to reflect the greater weight of countries such as China, Indonesia, India, Nigeria and Brazil. Reform should be a shared project. Australia is a willing partner." <cite ref="11"></cite> Minister Gillard called for "a greater role for Asian powers." <cite ref="18"></cite>

    "Australia will continue to work to ensure global institutions are fit-for-purpose, relevant, contemporary, accountable to member states, free from undue influence, and have an appropriately strong focus on the Indo-Pacific. We will continue to support reform efforts in the United Nations and its agencies to improve transparency, accountability and effectiveness." <cite ref="4"></cite>

    Australia also seeks evolution of the RBO "to ensure that new domains, such as cyberspace, are governed by rules that reinforce stability, support openness and facilitate trade." <cite ref="11"></cite> "Limiting the militarisation of space will also require the international community to work together to establish and manage a rules-based system – a prospect that does not seem likely in the immediate future." <cite ref="2"></cite>

    At the same time "we will work to ensure that the development of new rules and norms to address emerging challenges is consistent with enduring values and principles. This is particularly important in the case of critical technologies, including cyber and artificial intelligence, critical minerals and outer space." <cite ref="4"></cite>

    ## Requiring consistency

    Australian backing of the RBO requires that we take a "consistent approach". "We can&#39;t pick and choose" <cite ref="19"></cite>. The 2018 maritime boundary agreement between Australia and Timor-Leste, a much smaller power, is "a testament to the way in which international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, reinforces stability and allows countries to resolve disputes peacefully without resorting to force or coercion. It is an example of the rules-based order in action." <cite ref="11"></cite>

    ## Tangible deeds

    Standing up for the RBO requires "not just words" <cite ref="13"></cite>. but "tangible deeds". <cite ref="11"></cite> Support for the RBO is identified as something Australia has fought for before [[quote from E3?]] and may be prepared to fight for again. <cite ref="2"></cite>

    Australia is "committed to working with the United States and like-minded partners to maintain a rules-based order by making practical and meaningful military commitments where it is in our interests and capacity to do so." <cite ref="11"></cite> Australia&#39;s "third Strategic Defence Objective is to provide meaningful contributions to global responses to address threats to the rules-based global order which threaten Australia and its interests". <cite ref="2"></cite> In some circumstances, support for the RBO could even see Australia intervene militarily in another country in order to meet the "responsibility to protect." <cite ref="20"></cite>
