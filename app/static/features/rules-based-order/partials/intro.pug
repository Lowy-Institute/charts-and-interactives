  p On 20 July 2017, US President Donald Trump’s senior advisers attempted an ambush. It was a move that backfired spectacularly. 
  p According to Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, authors of A Very Stable Genius: Donald J Trump’s Testing of America, Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Director of the Economic Council Gary Cohn arranged a briefing for Trump ostensibly about the situation in Afghanistan. But the advisers were concerned about the “gaping holes in the president’s knowledge of history and of the alliances forged in the wake of World War II that served as the foundation of America’s strength in the world”, and they wanted to set him right. 
  p Mattis began with a slide which read “The post-war international rules-based order is the greatest gift of the greatest generation.” Steve Bannon, Trump’s adviser and the intellectual support to Trump’s instinctive suspicion of liberal internationalism, sat in on the meeting. According to Rucker and Leonnig, Bannon recoiled: “If you stood up and threatened to shoot [Trump], he couldn’t say ‘post-war rules-based international order’. It’s just not the way he thinks.” Bannon knew his man. Soon Trump was flying into a rage against NATO, free trade agreements and the Iran nuclear deal.

  p As you will see when you scroll further down this page, over the last decade or so the term “rules-based order” and variants such as “rules-based international order” and “liberal rules-based order” have peppered the speeches and policy statements of Australian governments with increasing frequency. References first appeared in the prime ministerial lexicon in 2008 under Kevin Rudd. They increased in 2011 under the combined leadership of Julia Gillard as Prime Minister and Kevin Rudd as Foreign Minister, and rose dramatically following the release of the Defence White Paper in 2016, before peaking in prime ministerial and ministerial speeches in September 2017-January 2018.
  p But the anecdote related by Rucker and Leonnig prompts a question: what was it all for? If the so-called leader of the free world throws a tantrum at the mere mention of a rules-based order, why would Australia invest in the rhetoric and the idea that underpins it? 
  p It is impossible to answer this question without first examining what Australia’s political leaders had in mind as they embraced the term ‘rules-based order’ over the last decade. We need to understand why the rules-based order became such an important, and arguably unique, part of official Australian rhetoric on foreign and security policy, and what the term was intended to convey. So as well as a quantitative study, the Lowy Institute has invited selected Australian policy makers and experts who have been central to the debate over the rules-based order to examine the public record since 2008 and comment on the evolution of this idea in Australia’s security and foreign policy debate.

  p As you will see in the annotated timeline laid out below, the rules-based order has been put to myriad uses by our political leaders. Sometimes it has been used to promote a global order centred around the UN and multilateralism, and at other times to push back against China’s claims to regional leadership. It has had a geographic dimension too: as the largest of the concentric circles that make up Australia’s security priorities as set out in official White Papers over the last decade, starting with the defence of Australian territory, then a stable and secure Asia, and finally a global order based on rules. At times it has had an ideological dimension when allied with the term ‘liberal’. 
  p Charting the decade in which the term ‘rules-based order’ has become popularised in Australia’s security debate, the timeline prompts one further question about the evolution of the rules-based order. Perhaps our politicians first saw the term as a politically acceptable euphemism for the indefinite continuance of US power in Asia, but do they now raise it as a call for rising powers to respect the rules in an era in which the US no longer has the biggest say? Find out below, as you navigate the ideas and events of this fascinating period and hear from those who crafted Australia’s response to it.
