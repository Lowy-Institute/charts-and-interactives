      <div class="content">
        In January, the ICC’s trial of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, the founder and leader of the Union of Congolese Patriots, began in The Hague, marking an important stage in efforts to establish responsibility for the use of children in military operations.

        In March, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber issued an arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir, the former President of Sudan, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. Omar al-Bashir became the first sitting head of state to be indicated by the ICC since its establishment in 2002.

        <p>Our quantitative study reveals that between 2013 and 2016 - coinciding largely with Tony Abbott’s prime ministership - there was a significant decrease in the number of references to a rules-based order in speeches and policy statements by the Australian government. </p>

        <p>The partial exception was Julie Bishop who, in October 2013, less than four weeks into her role as Australia's new Foreign Minister, gave an address to the Japan National Press Club in which she spoke about Japan and Australia being part of a “community of nations” that “have an interest in a stable, predictable, rules-based order – both around the world, and specifically in Asia.” In November 2013, Bishop gave a speech in Washington, DC linking the rules-based order to international trade.</p>

        <p>These two references by Bishop represent the few instances in which the concept of a rules-based order was used in Australia’s political lexicon between 2013 and 2016. Our study found that during his time as Prime Minister (September 2013 to September 2015), Tony Abbott did not use the term at all in key speeches.</p>
