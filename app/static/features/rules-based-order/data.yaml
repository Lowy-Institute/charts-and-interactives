          ## [Kevin Rudd address to The Brookings Institution, Washington](https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-15833)

          ### &quot;The Australia-US alliance and emerging challenges in the Asia-Pacific Region.&quot;

          Rudd&#39;s first visit to Washington as prime minister included a speech at the Brookings Institution replete with references to world order, including the first known use of &#39;rules-based order&#39; by an Australian Prime Minister:

          > The idea of a &quot;harmonious world&quot; depends on China being a participant in the world order and, along with others, acting in accordance with the rules of that order…we look to China to make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order.

          Rudd then travelled to Beijing where he delivered the same message, telling an audience of Chinese students in Peking University that realisation of the Chinese goal of a &#39;harmonious world&#39; depended on China &quot;being a participant in the world order and … acting in accordance with the rules of that order&quot;.

          ## [Kevin Rudd&#39;s National Security Statement, House of Representatives](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22chamber/hansardr/2008-12-04/0045%22)

          In Rudd&#39;s inaugural National Security Statement, the rules-based order is listed as one of the five principles of Australia&#39;s national security:

          > 1. Maintaining Australia&#39;s territorial and border integrity.
          > 2. Promoting Australia&#39;s political sovereignty
          > 3. Preserving Australia&#39;s cohesive and resilient society and the long-term strengths of our economy.
          > 4. Protecting Australians and Australian interests both at home and abroad.
          > 5. Promoting an international environment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, that is stable, peaceful and prosperous, together with a global rules based order which enhances Australia&#39;s national interests.

          Rudd also said:

          > At the global level, we are committed to multilateral institutions, and in particular the United Nations, to promote a rules based international order that enhances our security and economy. We believe those that share the benefits of these systems must also share the responsibilities of supporting and enhancing them.

          ## [Defence White Paper](https://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/2009/)

          Maintaining the rules-based order is referenced as a possible objective of military operations:

          > the ADF has to be prepared to contribute to military contingencies in the rest of the world, in support of efforts by the international community to uphold global security and a rules-based international order, where our interests align and where we have the capacity to do so.

          In particular, defence of the rules-based order is cited as a justification for humanitarian intervention:

          > For a rules-based global security order to work, occasionally it is necessary to act to restore order. Within the UN context, the &#39;responsibility to protect&#39; principle, which is currently at an important stage of development, holds that states are responsible for the protection of their own citizens from mass atrocities, and that the international community should encourage and assist states to exercise that authority. Australia supports the principle, and recognises that, on occasion, it may be necessary for other states to intervene, under the auspices of a UN Security Council resolution, if a state cannot or will not protect its population.

          The rules-based order concept is also used to link Australia&#39;s local, regional and global interests:

          > These strategic interests are presented in geographical terms, as a hierarchy that reflects both relative priorities for action from a defence planning perspective, and our realistic capacity for influence through the employment of military power. They are interlocking - a stable rules-based global security order increases the likelihood of strategic stability in the Asia-Pacific region, which in turn makes more likely the maintenance of a secure immediate neighbourhood and ultimately a secure Australia.

          ## [The Melbourne Statement](https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/wayback/20190808185745/https:/foreignminister.gov.au/releases/Pages/2010/kr_mr_101106a.aspx?ministerid=2)

          This statement laid out the shared US-Australian interests on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of US-Australia diplomatic relations. It also appears to be the first time the term &#39;rules-based order&#39; was used by a senior US government official – Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.

          The Melbourne Statement reaffirms US and Australian dedication to &quot;the enhancement of an international rules-based order, both within our region and for the world.&quot;

          Speaking in Melbourne, Secretary Clinton [said](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10686147):

          > &quot;We obviously share the view that we want to see China&#39;s rise be successful, bringing benefits to the Chinese people, but [we want China] to take on greater responsibility and a rules-based approach towards all of its neighbours.&quot;

          ## [Prime Minister Julie Gillard&#39;s speech to the AsiaLink and Asia Society](https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-18161)

          Reflecting on the future of the Asian Century, Gillard said:

          > Australians should be optimistic. Not because change is always good - but because Australia is always good enough to make the best of change. And Australians should be determined. Because the prize is rich indeed. A peaceful, open, rules-based Asian system. Effective regional institutions, respect for all countries of the region, large and small. Space for a rising China. A robust alliance between Australia and the United States. That is the Asian future we seek in the Asian future we face.

          Rudd warns that &quot;The worst outcome that you could ever imagine for a country like Australia, is that there be conflict or war between the United States and China&quot;, and argues that the development of new institutions is a race against time:

          > We began to debate two or three years ago on how we could build an Asia Pacific community in a region which doesn&#39;t have regional institutions capable of bringing around the table the Americans, the Chinese and the rest of us, on how we craft the rules of the game for this region, for the next half-century. Because if you fail to do that, and to cultivate and to develop a culture, and have it of economic and security policy and foreign policy cooperation, it is very easy to drift in the reverse direction.

          This document did not focus on security. Notably, on two occasions it argues that Australia should play a part in increasing the role of Asian countries in the rules-based order:

          > Australia&#39;s future is irrevocably tied to the stability and sustainable security of our diverse region…We will continue to support a greater role for Asian countries in a rules-based regional and global order. Australia&#39;s alliance with the United States and a strong US presence in Asia will support regional stability, as will China&#39;s full participation in regional developments.

          In Prime Minister Gillard&#39;s launch statement for the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, the rules-based order becomes specifically &#39;regional&#39;:

          > At the same time, all countries in the region, particularly the major powers, have a deep interest in strategic stability. So we need not be pessimistic - but just as we work to shape the economic future of our region, so too do we work to shape our security environment.

          > We are supporting the stabilising presence of the United States, a strong Defence Force, building habits of trust and co-operation in our region and a rules-based regional order. We have an ally in Washington - respect in Beijing - and more.

          The National Security Strategy itself contains 7 references to &#39;rules-based&#39;, but all in the context of the global order, rather than regional. The role of the US is considered central to maintenance of the rules-based order:

          > The United States is integral to global economic growth and security, and provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today.

          Adherence to the rules-based order is characterised as a reflection of Australian values and history:

          > The rule of law provides the framework in which government balances its responsibility to protect Australia, its people and its interests while preserving our civil liberties. These values influence our foreign and defence policy. Our values underpin our reputation as a responsible member of the international community, committed to a rules-based global order.

          ## [Defence White Paper](https://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/2013/)

          References to the rules-based order in this White Paper are made largely in geographic terms. Australia&#39;s primary strategic interest is defence of the continent, followed by a secure region, and finally a rules-based order. As with the 2009 Defence White Paper, this document describes the UN as central to maintaining a global rules-based order:

          > Both in and beyond Southeast Asia, Australia supports a rules-based regional security order that fosters cooperation, eases tensions between states and provides incentives to major powers like China and India to rise peacefully. In particular, it is in our interests that no hostile power in the Indo-Pacific is able to coerce or intimidate others through force or the threat of force.

          The government was firmly committed to the rules-based order through its actions. For example, when Malaysian airlines MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014 one of our first responses was to seek the support of the United Nations Security Council. Likewise, the government campaigned for and won a seat on the UN Human Rights Council and we submitted to voluntary arbitration through UNCLOS on our maritime boundary dispute with Timor-Leste.

You cannot have a safe and secure world if powerful countries are able to take what they want. Plainly, what we have seen in Ukraine over the last six months or so, is an increasingly aggressive role by Russia and it seems that Russia is now stepping out of the shadows and overtly trying to achieve its objects of domination in Ukraine and it is completely, absolutely and utterly unacceptable.&quot;

          ## [Defence White Paper](https://www.defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/Links.asp)

          There are 56 references to the &#39;rules based&#39; order in this White Paper, which explicitly points to Russia and North Korea as challenges to the order, and also lists terrorism, piracy, and people smugglers as other risks.

          The definition of the rules-based order in this White Paper stresses the capacity for evolution in the order, and argues that the order has become more important due to &#39;growing interconnectivity&#39;:

          > The stability of the rules-based global order is essential for Australia&#39;s security and prosperity. A rules-based global order means a shared commitment by all countries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules which evolve over time, such as international law and regional security arrangements. This shared commitment has become even more important with growing interconnectivity, which means that events across the world have the potential to affect Australia&#39;s security and prosperity. The Government is committed to making practical and effective military contributions to global security operations to maintain the rules-based order and address shared security challenges where it is in our interest to do so.

          The US is described as being central to the stability of the rules-based order:

          > The global strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order on which Australia relies for our security and prosperity. The world will continue to look to the United States for leadership in global security affairs and to lead military coalitions that support international security and the rules-based global order.

          In his [April 2016 address](https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-40306) launching the Australian Cyber Security Centre, Prime Minister Turnbull disclosed the capability and emphasised consistency with the rules-based order:

          > &quot;Defensive measures may not always be adequate to respond to serious cyber incidents … The Government can draw on a range of options to respond, such as law enforcement, diplomatic or economic measures.An offensive cyber capability, housed in the Australian Signals Directorate, provides another option … *The use of such a capability is subject to stringent legal oversight and is consistent with our support for the international rules-based order and our obligations under international law.* Acknowledging this offensive capability, adds a level of deterrence. It adds to our credibility as we promote norms of good behaviour on the international stage.&quot; (emphasis added)

          ## [Joint press conference](https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-40347)

          ### Prime Minister Turnbull and Foreign Minister Marise Payne on the South China Sea arbitration decision \&lt;a\&gt; BISHOP - This judgement was not as strongly supported by the US as had been expected. It did not receive endorsement by ASEAN or of all claimant nations, which emboldened China to expand its South China Sea militarisation. \&lt;/a\&gt;

          The Hague Tribunal&#39;s decision on the South China Sea became pivotal to subsequent debate surrounding China&#39;s ambitions, its commitment to the rules-based order, and the willingness of the US and regional states to defend that order:

          > This Tribunal, as you know, is established in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is a codification of international maritime law. It was established so that countries can resolve disputes peacefully in accordance with international law. The UN convention on the Law of the Sea, and the Arbitral Tribunal are absolutely crucial elements of the international rules based order which underpins peace, stability and prosperity around the world but especially in our part of the world for decades. All of us, all countries large and small have benefitted enormously from this system which facilitates trade and enables disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means.

          China&#39;s attempts to exercise de-facto control of the South China Sea, and in particular the building of large Chinese military facilities on disputed features, raised significant concerns in Australia about Beijing&#39;s willingness to abide by international law and settle disputes peacefully and without the threat or use of force.

          The precedents for the way China might use its growing power elsewhere in the region were ominous. China helped negotiate UNCLOS, including the setting of extensive exclusive economic zones, and subsequently ratified the Treaty. Yet Beijing denounced and ignored the Tribunal&#39;s findings, which had the effect of significantly narrowing the legal basis of China&#39;s claims in the South China Sea.

          The most assertive Australian statement thus far on the &#39;liberal&#39; element of the rules-based order:

          > The importance of liberal values and institutions should not be underestimated or ignored.

          > While non-democracies such as China can thrive when participating in the present system, an essential pillar of our preferred order is democratic community.

          > Domestic democratic habits of negotiating and compromise are essential to powerful countries resolving their disagreements according to international law and rules.

          > History also shows democracy and democratic institutions are essential for nations if they are to reach their economic potential.

          > The only countries in the world who have escaped the &#39;middle-income&#39; trap to become wealthy, high-income and advanced economies are democracies –with the exception of a small number of oil-rich Middle Eastern states.

          > Liberal-democratic institutions such as rule-of-law rather than rule by executive privilege, civilian control of the military, independent and competent courts, protection of property and intellectual property rights from state appropriation or theft, and limitations on the role of the state in commercial and social affairs remain the prerequisites for stable and prosperous societies, as they are for the creation of a vibrant and innovative private sector.

          > While it is appropriate for different states to discover their own pathway leading toward political reform, history shows that embrace of liberal democratic institutions is the most successful foundation for nations seeking economic prosperity and social stability.

          > Australia is an active and vocal advocate of the liberal rules based order because the continuation of the long and prosperous peace depend on it.&quot;>

          ### Former Minister for Foreign Affairs

          The speech was intended as strong support for the rules-based order and for democracy and freedom. These are enduring values that must be defended strongly. It is simply a statement of fact that most high-income nations are liberal democracies with independent institutions.

          My speeches reflected my understanding that the rules-based order was developed, under United States leadership, to prevent a repeat of the horrors of global conflict in the two world wars. It was designed to protect the rights of all nations and to prevent more powerful countries coercing and dominating less powerful countries.

          ### 16th IISS Asia Security Summit, Shangri-La Dialogue

          Turnbull refers to a &quot;US anchored rules-based order&quot;, and other references to the rules-based order place it directly in the context of great-power competition between the US and China:

          > And we should be under no illusions: If we are to maintain the dynamism of the region then we must preserve the rules-based structure that has enabled it thus far. This means cooperation not unilateral actions to seize or create territory or militarise disputed areas. This means competing within the framework of international law not winning through corruption, interference or coercion ...
          ... some fear that China will seek to impose a latter day Monroe Doctrine on this hemisphere in order to dominate the region, marginalising the role and contribution of other nations, in particular the United States. Such a dark view of our future would see China isolating those who stand in opposition to or are not aligned with its interests, while using its economic largesse to reward those toeing the line.

          > The ballistic missile tests and North Korea&#39;s ongoing reckless and menacing behaviour, are in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, is a threat to regional and global security and stability and is in violation of the rules-based order we seek to promote and advance.

          [Bishop, 5 July](https://www.foreignminister.gov.au/minister/julie-bishop/media-release/australia-condemns-dprk-missile-test)

          > The world expects that we live in a rules-based system and this unacceptable missile launch is in breach of numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions. \&lt;a\&gt;BISHOP - North Korea is a rogue state in that it refuses to abide by international conventions and continues to pose a threat to South Korea and Japan. It uses the threat of military action to extract concessions from other nations and the regime&#39;s treatment of its own people is reprehensible.\&lt;/a\&gt;

          ## Malcolm Turnbull, Launch of the Government&#39;s Foreign Policy White Paper

          From Prime Minister&#39;s speech at the launch of the White Paper:

          > In the global ocean, there is always a risk, as Lee Kuan Yew observed: &quot;The big fish will eat the little fish, and the little fish will eat the shrimps&quot;. Or as the Athean ambassador said to the Melians: &quot;In the real world, there is justice only between equals. As for the rest, the strong do as they will, and the weak suffer as they must.

          > So whether it&#39;s in Lee Kuan Yew&#39;s words or Thucydides&#39;, we will never agree that might is right. \&lt;a\&gt;MAUDE - This is a central element of the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper&#39;s framing of the rules-based order – the idea that, as a middle power, Australia will always be better off in a global order that is based at least in part on agreed rules, even if imperfectly applied, rather than power alone.\&lt;/a\&gt; The rules-based order protects us all and it protects us, in particular.

          ## Foreign Policy White Paper \&lt;a\&gt; BISHOP - The central theme of the Foreign Policy White paper was a defence of the rules-based order. It was my judgement that the order was under challenge by China, Russia, North Korea and some other nations. There was apathy or indifference to its importance in many developing nations. The WP was intended to be a call to action for our institutions and for other nations to defend the order, as if it were broken, the world would be facing an unpredictable future.\&lt;/a\&gt;

          According to the Prime Minister&#39;s introduction, &quot;This Foreign Policy White Paper shows Australia to be focused on our region, determined to realise a secure, open and prosperous Indo–Pacific, while also strengthening and diversifying partnerships across the globe.&quot;

          References to the rules-based order in this White Paper reflect this regional focus, but not exclusively:

          > Australia&#39;s interests are strongly served by acting with others to support a rules-based international order. Australia will encourage and tangibly support the leadership of the United States to this end.

          The White Paper also includes references to the &quot;liberal character of the rules-based order&quot; and the &quot;rules-based component of the international order&quot;:

          > Australia will continue strongly to support US global leadership. The Government recognises there is greater debate and uncertainty in the United States about the costs and benefits of its leadership in parts of the international system. We believe that the United States&#39; engagement to support a rules-based order is in its own interests and in the interests of wider international stability and prosperity. Without sustained US support, the effectiveness and liberal character of the rules-based order will decline.

          > Australia has a long record of helping to develop the rules-based component of the global order.

          The White Paper is also clear that Australia will support reforms that give new and emerging powers a greater role in the international system. It says Australia will be a willing partner in such a shared project. The White Paper is clear, though, that we should guard against illiberal changes to rules and norms. Change that undermined international law or the rights and freedoms set out in UN declarations, for example, would not be in Australia&#39;s interests.

          Argues the rules-based order is essential for moderating the great-power contest between the US and China:

          > strategic competition has to be bound by principles and rules.

          > The most recent positive example from Australia&#39;s perspective of how this approach can function positively and effectively is the maritime boundary treaty signed between Australia and Timor-Leste in March.

          > This treaty was negotiated through the first ever conciliation held under the auspices of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Treaty is a testament to the way in which international law, in particular in this case the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, reinforces stability and allows countries to engage and resolve disputes peacefully, without coercion and by the rules.

          > It is a good example of the rules-based global order in action.

Disengagement creates a vacuum that others step into. \&lt;/a\&gt;

          This came down to a difference of opinion with the Trump administration, where I had argued that the US should remain in the HRC to drive reform and effect change from within. The Administration determined that the HRC was beyond redemption and that attempts to improve it would inevitably fail and therefore the more dramatic step of resigning would send a stronger message.

          On the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the Iran nuclear deal):

          > ... maintaining support for the JCPOA serves our interests in nuclear non-proliferation and in reinforcing the rules-based international system. It is consistent with Australia&#39;s position on other non-proliferation issues…And it serves our interest in encouraging rules-based approaches to resolving other issues of international concern, including the South China Sea.

          Morrison also announced that Australia would recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel:

          > The starting point for their deliberation was Australia&#39;s absolute commitment to a two-state solution, these are the guard rails, with a secure Israel and future Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. I also required that their deliberations respect Australia&#39;s obligations under international law and UN Security Council resolutions – two things that are fundamental, I think, to Australia&#39;s interests in a rules-based order. You can&#39;t look at these things in isolation. Our foreign policy is guided by our fundamental interest in ensuring that internationally agreed rules continue to safeguard our security and prosperity. We don&#39;t get to pick and choose.

Our interests are not served by isolationism and protectionism. But it also does not serve our national interests when international institutions demand conformity rather than independent cooperation on global issues … We should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community. And worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy … When it comes to setting global standards, we&#39;ve not been as involved as we could be. We cannot afford to leave it to others to set the standards that will shape our global economy. I&#39;m determined for Australia will play a more active role in standards setting.&quot;
