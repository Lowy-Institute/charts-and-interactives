    summary: |
      Prime Minister Kevin Rudd began his term seeking to shape the US–China relationship, establish new regional institutions, and enhance international cooperation on climate change. His government’s first official act was ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Mr Rudd was challenged by the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and a marked increase in arrivals of boats carrying asylum seekers to Australia. He leveraged the GFC to lobby for establishment of a Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ meeting — including Australia. His government launched Australia’s successful bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (from 2013–2014).

          ## Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s address at The Brookings Institution, Washington DC

          Mr Rudd’s first visit to Washington as prime minister included a speech at the Brookings Institution replete with references to world order, including the first known use of ‘rules- based order’ by an Australian prime minister:

          > The idea of a “harmonious world” depends on China being a participant in the world order and, along with others, acting in accordance with the rules of that order … we look to China to make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order.

          Prime Minister Rudd then travelled to Beijing where he delivered the same message, telling an audience of Chinese students in Peking University that realisation of the Chinese goal of a “harmonious world” depended on China acting in accordance with the rules of the global order.

          ## Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s address at the Asia Society, Sydney

          In a June 2008 address at the Asia Society, Prime Minister Rudd proposed a far-reaching ‘Asia–Pacific Community’, a new regional body that he described as the first step towards an Asian version of the European Union. The proposal got little regional traction, arguably demonstrating the limited regional appetite for closer multilateral ties.

          > We need to have a vision for an Asia–Pacific Community, a vision that embraces: A regional institution which spans the entire Asia–Pacific region — including the United States, Japan, China, India, Indonesia and the other states of the region; [And] a regional institution which is able to engage in the full spectrum of dialogue, cooperation and action on economic and political matters and future challenges related to security. The purpose is to encourage the development of a genuine and comprehensive sense of community whose habitual operating principle is cooperation.

Responding to the GFC, twenty of the world’s largest economies — the Group of Twenty (G20) — assembled at the leaders' level for the first time ever in late 2008. The crisis sparked a commitment from world leaders to work towards a set of global financial rules that would reduce the chances of it happening again. Australia was a key contributor to these discussions.

          ## 2008 National Security Statement

          In December 2008, Prime Minister Rudd released Australia’s inaugural National Security Statement (NSS). The NSS outlined the government’s plans for a national security structure that “provide[d] improved strategic direction within the national security community, support[ed] whole-of-government national security policy development and crisis response, and promote[d] a cohesive national security culture”.

          The rules-based order was listed as part of the fifth principle of Australia’s national security:

          > 1. Maintaining Australia&#39;s territorial and border integrity.
          > 2. Promoting Australia&#39;s political sovereignty.
          > 3. Preserving Australia&#39;s cohesive and resilient society and the long-term strengths of our economy.
          > 4. Protecting Australians and Australian interests both at home and abroad.
          > 5. Promoting an international environment, particularly in the Asia–Pacific region, that is stable, peaceful and prosperous, together with a global rules-based order which enhances Australia&#39;s national interests.

          Presenting the NSS before the Australian federal parliament, Prime Minister Rudd said:

          > At the global level, we are committed to multilateral institutions, and in particular the United Nations, to promote a rules-based international order that enhances our security and economy. We believe those that share the benefits of these systems must also share the responsibilities of supporting and enhancing them.

          ## 2009 Defence White Paper

          The 2009 Defence White Paper was notable for its increased focus on China and on Australia’s naval capabilities.

          Maintaining the rules-based order was referenced as a possible objective of military operations:


          > ... the [Australian Defence Force] has to be prepared to contribute to military contingencies in the rest of the world, in support of efforts by the international community to uphold global security and a rules-based international order, where our interests align and where we have the capacity to do so.

          Notably, defence of the rules-based order was cited as a possible justification for humanitarian intervention:

          > For a rules-based global security order to work, occasionally it is necessary to act to restore order. Within the UN context, the ‘responsibility to protect’ principle, which is currently at an important stage of development, holds that states are responsible for the protection of their own citizens from mass atrocities, and that the international community should encourage and assist states to exercise that authority. Australia supports the principle, and recognises that, on occasion, it may be necessary for other states to intervene, under the auspices of a UN Security Council resolution, if a state cannot or will not protect its population.

          The rules-based order concept was also used to link Australia’s local, regional, and global interests:

          >  These strategic interests are presented in geographical terms, as a hierarchy that reflects both relative priorities for action from a defence planning perspective, and our realistic capacity for influence through the employment of military power. They are interlocking — a stable rules-based global security order increases the likelihood of strategic stability in the Asia–Pacific region, which in turn makes more likely the maintenance of a secure immediate neighbourhood and ultimately a secure Australia.

    summary: |
      Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke more about regional order than global order. She referred to creating “space for a rising China” and focused on Australia’s domestic readiness for the Asian century. At the same time, Ms Gillard sought to strengthen the US alliance and encourage American commitment to the region. In November 2011, she and US President Barack Obama announced the rotational deployment of US Marine Corps to Darwin. Prime Minister Gillard also laid the groundwork for the resumption of uranium sales to India. The Palestinian push for recognition in multilateral fora occupied her government more than many expected.

          ## Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s joint statement, Melbourne

          The joint Australian–US statement, referred to as ‘The Melbourne Statement’, marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between Australia and the United States. It laid out shared interests, including a common dedication to “the enhancement of an international rules-based order, both within our region and for the world”.

          This appears to be one of the first times ‘rules-based order’ was used by a senior US government official — on this occasion, Secretary Clinton.

          Commenting on the statement, Secretary Clinton said, “We obviously share the view that we want to see China’s rise be successful, bringing benefits to the Chinese people, but [we want China] to take on greater responsibility and a rules-based approach toward all of its neighbours.”

The prime minister announced that this paper would consider how Australia could take greater advantage of the economic growth of Asia.

          Reflecting on the future of the Asian century, Prime Minister Gillard said:

          > Australians should be optimistic. Not because change is always good — but because Australia is always good enough to make the best of change. And Australians should be determined. Because the prize is rich indeed. A peaceful, open, rules-based Asian system. Effective regional institutions, respect for all countries of the region, large and small. Space for a rising China. A robust alliance between Australia and the United States. That is the Asian future we seek in the Asian future we face.

          ## Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd’s address at the Oxford Business Alumni Forum, Sydney

          Foreign Minister Rudd’s speech to the Oxford Business Alumni Forum in Sydney included a wide-ranging discussion of the rise of China. Focusing on “Australia’s direction in a dual superpower world”, the foreign minister predicted that China would eclipse the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2019. He warned that “the worst outcome that you could ever imagine for a country like Australia, is that there be conflict or war between the United States and China”.

          Mr Rudd argued that the development of new institutions was a race against time:

          > We began to debate two or three years ago on how we could build an Asia–Pacific community in a region which doesn’t have regional institutions capable of bringing around the table the Americans, the Chinese, and the rest of us, on how we craft the rules of the game for this region, for the next half-century. Because if you fail to do that, and to cultivate and to develop a culture, and have it of economic and security policy and foreign policy cooperation, it is very easy to drift in the reverse direction.

          In October 2012, Prime Minister Gillard released the government’s Australia in the Asian Century White Paper in an address at the Lowy Institute. The White Paper outlined twenty-five “national objectives” to prepare Australia for the rise of Asia in the twenty-first century. These included strengthening regional institutions, encouraging Asian language teaching in schools, strengthening the credentials of Australia’s universities, and increasing diplomatic presence in the region.

          At several points, the White Paper argued that Australia should play a part in increasing the role of Asian countries in the rules-based order:

          > Australia’s future is irrevocably tied to the stability and sustainable security of our diverse region … We will continue to support a greater role for Asian countries in a rules-based regional and global order. Australia’s alliance with the United States and a strong US presence in Asia will support regional stability, as will China’s full participation in regional developments.

So we need not be pessimistic — but just as we work to shape the economic future of our region, so too do we work to shape our security environment. We are supporting the stabilising presence of the United States, a strong Defence Force, building habits of trust and co-operation in our region and a rules-based regional order. We have an ally in Washington — respect in Beijing — and more.

          ## 2013 National Security Strategy

          In January 2013, the Gillard government released its National Security Strategy, outlining Australia’s national security risks, priorities, and capabilities. During her launch address, Prime Minister Gillard described the national security environment as “post 9/11”. The Strategy shifted Australia’s focus from non-state actors back to states.

          The Strategy referred to the rules-based global order seven time, but in her remarks at the launch, Ms Gillard once again framed the rules-based order in regional terms:

          > We have long championed a multilateral, rules-based order in our region in which disputes are resolved peacefully, without the use or threat of force or coercion.

          The Strategy described the United States as central to maintenance of the rules-based order:

          > The United States is integral to global economic growth and security, and provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today.

          Adherence to the rules-based order was characterised as a reflection of Australian values and history:

          > The rule of law provides the framework in which government balances its responsibility to protect Australia, its people and its interests while preserving our civil liberties. These values influence our foreign and defence policy. Our values underpin our reputation as a responsible member of the international community, committed to a rules-based global order.

          ## 2013 Defence White Paper

          Compared to the 2009 Defence White Paper, this policy statement used more diplomatic language to describe China. It also advanced planning for the use of Australian territory to support the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia”. The White Paper adopted the Indo–Pacific concept and emphasised closer engagement in Australia’s immediate region. Defence of the continent and a secure region were identified as higher priorities than “a stable, rules-based global order”, although Australia’s regional interests were defined to include a “rules-based regional security order”. The White Paper contained 11 references to the rules-based order.

          > Both in and beyond Southeast Asia, Australia supports a rules-based regional security order that fosters cooperation, eases tensions between states and provides incentives to major powers like China and India to rise peacefully. In particular, it is in our interests that no hostile power in the Indo–Pacific is able to coerce or intimidate others through force or the threat of force.

On 31 August 2013, President Obama announced that the United States “should take military action” but that he would seek authorisation from Congress before doing so. Congress did not authorise military action. In September 2013, Russia facilitated a deal under which Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and handed over 1300 tons of chemical weapons for destruction.

          I was concerned at the impact on US global authority from the failure to enforce the “red line”. US authority since the Second World War has come from an international understanding that under certain circumstances it will take military action. This situation increased the risks of miscalculation should some regimes believe that was no longer the case. Russia’s intervention was to support the Assad regime and to also take on a role of international leadership.

    summary: |
      Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s foreign-policy agenda was shaped by a series of dramatic events. In 2014, the Islamic State terrorist organisation swept through Iraq and Syria, and Russia annexed Crimea. In July 2014, Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. In the same period, China became more internationally assertive, including by stepping up its island-building in the South China Sea.

      As part of its effort to end illegal maritime immigration, the Abbott government initiated a policy of turning back boats or sending their passengers to offshore processing facilities. This policy was known as ‘Operation Sovereign Borders’. Some international lawyers and human rights groups argued that this was inconsistent with Australia’s international obligations.

      While Prime Minister Abbott used the specific term ‘rules-based order’ less often than prime ministers Rudd, Gillard, and Turnbull, he often spoke against a world in which “might is right”, and used the phrase “good global citizen” to describe Australia, and what Australia wanted China to be.

          [On Operation Sovereign Borders] “The goal was to prevent criminal people-smuggling networks from preying on vulnerable people and enticing many of them to their deaths. Critics of the policy rarely acknowledged that more than 1200 people died at sea in the five years prior to Operation Sovereign Borders.”

Plainly, what we have seen in Ukraine over the last six months or so, is an increasingly aggressive role by Russia and it seems that Russia is now stepping out of the shadows and overtly trying to achieve its objects of domination in Ukraine and it is completely, absolutely and utterly unacceptable.

              In August 2014, Foreign Minister Bishop and Indonesia Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa signed a Joint Understanding in implementation of the Lombok Treaty. The Joint Understanding provided an agreed approach to enhance intelligence cooperation. It followed claims that Australia had spied on Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. According to the Joint Understanding, neither country would "use any of their intelligence, including surveillance capacities, or other resources, in ways that would harm the interests of the Parties".

              In September 2014, Prime Minister Abbott announced Australia would join US-led airstrikes and extend its military campaign from Iraq into Syria. The government maintained the legal basis for the extended air strikes as the "collective self-defence" of Iraq. Mirroring the United States, Australia referred to areas of Syria under control of the Islamic State terrorist organisation as “ungoverned space”.

          Prime Minister Abbott addressed the United Nations General Assembly in the final months of Australia’s two-year term on the United Nations Security Council. He discussed the role of the United Nations:

          > “Like any institution, the United Nations is an imperfect instrument. Still, it’s better than might-is-right and it gives good arguments the best chance to prevail. Despite faults and failures, the UN has worked for peace and progress for nearly 70 years and Australia has been proud to play its part.”

          On 17 November 2014, President Xi delivered an address to the Australian federal parliament in which he said that to achieve “the Chinese dream”, China would “promote the rule of law in an all-round way, stay committed to socialism with Chinese features, advance the modernisation drive and steadily improve people’s lives”.

          Commenting on the address at a dinner in honour of President Xi, Prime Minister Abbott said Australia’s “respect and affection” for China had been reinforced by the remarks, and that:

          > I have never heard a Chinese leader commit so explicitly to a rule-based international order founded on the principle that we should all treat others as we would be treated ourselves.

          In July 2015, Prime Minister Abbott referred to the AIIB as an example of China’s willingness and ability to play a global leadership role:

          > ... obviously, what we want to do is encourage China to assume a role commensurate with its strength and that’s why under the right conditions, which we were able to obtain, we were so keen to be involved in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a good illustration of the role that China can have within a rules-based international order.

      Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s international agenda was dominated by the struggle against Islamic State, increasingly assertive Chinese behaviour (including in Australia), the election of US President Donald Trump, and escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The Turnbull government’s reaction included a series of major policy documents and internal reforms in which the rules-based order figured prominently.

          ## 2016 Defence White Paper

          There were 56 references to the "rules-based" order in this White Paper, a marked increase from previous Defence White Papers. References explicitly pointed to Russia and North Korea as challenges to the order. The White Paper also listed terrorism, piracy, and people smugglers as risks.

          The definition of the rules-based order in this White Paper stressed the capacity for evolution in the order, and argued that the order had become more important due to “growing interconnectivity”:

          > The stability of the rules-based global order is essential for Australia’s security and prosperity. A rules-based global order means a shared commitment by all countries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules which evolve over time, such as international law and regional security arrangements. This shared commitment has become even more important with growing interconnectivity, which means that events across the world have the potential to affect Australia’s security and prosperity. The Government is committed to making practical and effective military contributions to global security operations to maintain the rules-based order and address shared security challenges where it is in our interest to do so.

          The US was described as being central to the stability of the rules-based order:

          > The global strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order on which Australia relies for our security and prosperity. The world will continue to look to the United States for leadership in global security affairs and to lead military coalitions that support international security and the rules-based global order.

          The release of the Defence White Paper in February 2016 marked a new high point in Australia’s championing of a rules-based order, and this concept was explicitly integrated in defining our ‘strategic defence interests’ and ‘strategic defence objectives’: in other words, what we would be willing to fight for. Although the term remained in use in the 2020 update to that white paper, nonetheless the emphasis shifted to shaping the strategic environment, deterring threats, and responding with force where necessary — and a new focus was placed on protecting regional resilience and national sovereignty.

          In his April 2016 address launching the Australian Cyber Security Centre, Prime Minister Turnbull disclosed Australia’s offensive cyber capability and emphasised consistency with the rules-based order:

          > Defensive measures may not always be adequate to respond to serious cyber incidents … The Government can draw on a range of options to respond, such as law enforcement, diplomatic or economic measures. An offensive cyber capability, housed in the Australian Signals Directorate, provides another option … The use of such a capability is subject to stringent legal oversight and is consistent with our support for the international rules-based order and our obligations under international law. Acknowledging this offensive capability, adds a level of deterrence. It adds to our credibility as we promote norms of good behaviour on the international stage.

          > This Tribunal, as you know, is established in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is a codification of international maritime law. It was established so that countries can resolve disputes peacefully in accordance with international law. The UN convention on the Law of the Sea, and the Arbitral Tribunal are absolutely crucial elements of the international rules-based order which underpins peace, stability and prosperity around the world but especially in our part of the world for decades. All of us, all countries large and small have benefitted enormously from this system which facilitates trade and enables disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means.

          China’s attempts to exercise de facto control of the South China Sea, and in particular the building of large Chinese military facilities on disputed features, raised significant concerns in Australia about Beijing’s willingness to abide by international law and settle disputes peacefully and without the threat or use of force. The precedents for the way China might use its growing power elsewhere in the region were ominous. China helped negotiate UNCLOS, including the setting ofextensive exclusive economic zones, and subsequently ratified the Treaty. Yet Beijing denounced and ignored the Tribunal’s findings, which had the effect of significantly narrowing the legal basis of China’s claims in the South China Sea.

          The twenty-first century history of the idea of a rules-based order coincides unpleasantly with the steady erosion and subversion of that very order in the South China Sea. As early as 2008, disturbing reports were emerging of harassment of fishing boats and energy exploration projects in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In 2009, the so-called Impeccable incident occurred, with Chinese maritime militias interfering with an American surveillance vessel in the Chinese EEZ off Hainan Island, in defiance of the most accepted interpretation of freedom of navigation under UNCLOS.

          By 2010, reckless action by Chinese forces was risking conflict in the South China Sea, and by 2012 a similar dynamic was occurring in the East China Sea against Japan. In 2013, China sought to co-opt the idea of a rules-based order by declaring an air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over much of the disputed area in the East China Sea — a move that was challenged in particular by Japan, the United States, and Australia (the latter incurring a chill in diplomatic relations).

          In 2013–14, China shifted to a passive-aggressive strategy of building militarised islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea. Again, this was not purely defiance of the rules-based order. Instead, the Chinese government sought to manipulate the idea of maritime peace and stability by finally signing the CUES agreement (Code for Unalerted Encounters at Sea) and then claiming that its action in threatening foreign forces that flew or sailed near the artificial islands was defensive.

          Meanwhile, ever since 2002, China has variously delayed or distorted prospects for a Code of Conduct on the Behaviour of Forces in the South China Sea. Once it had completed its island-building to essentially remake the facts in the water, China turned its diplomacy towards seeking a Code of Conduct that would not so much constrain its own behaviour but rather exclude ‘external’ countries from freedom of navigation in those waterways.

          ## Fullerton lecture — Change and uncertainty in the Indo–Pacific

          The most assertive Australian statement thus far on the 'liberal' element of the rules-based order came from former Foreign Minister the Honourable Julie Bishop in an address to the International Institute for Strategic Studies:

          > The importance of liberal values and institutions should not be underestimated or ignored. While non-democracies such as China can thrive when participating in the present system, an essential pillar of our preferred order is democratic community. Domestic democratic habits of negotiating and compromise are essential to powerful countries resolving their disagreements according to international law and rules. History also shows democracy and democratic institutions are essential for nations if they are to reach their economic potential.<cite class="maude" tooltip="How to juggle our values with our political, economic, and security interests in Asia is the contemporary sharp edge of an old dilemma. Australia cannot afford to make values the primary driver of our engagement with Asia. That would close the space for greater cooperation with partners such as Vietnam or even Indonesia. But the liberal character of many global rules and norms — open trade, international law, political and religious freedoms, racial and gender equality, and broader human rights — supports Australia’s security and prosperity and reflects who we are as a nation. It has become more important for Australia to assert and defend these values, especially as China has become more authoritarian, more willing to interfere in our domestic affairs, and increasingly determined to reshape parts of the global system to legitimise Communist Party rule."></cite>

          > The only countries in the world who have escaped the 'middle-income' trap to become wealthy, high-income and advanced economies are democracies — with the exception of a small number of oil-rich Middle Eastern states.

          > Liberal-democratic institutions such as rule-of-law rather than rule by executive privilege, civilian control of the military, independent and competent courts, protection of property and intellectual property rights from state appropriation or theft, and limitations on the role of the state in commercial and social affairs remain the prerequisites for stable and prosperous societies, as they are for the creation of a vibrant and innovative private sector.

          > While it is appropriate for different states to discover their own pathway leading toward political reform, history shows that embrace of liberal democratic institutions is the most successful foundation for nations seeking economic prosperity and social stability. Australia is an active and vocal advocate of the liberal rules-based order because the continuation of the long and prosperous peace depend on it.”

          During his address, Prime Minister Turnbull referred to a US anchored rules-based order. Other references to the rules-based order placed it directly in the context of great-power competition between the United States and China:

          > And we should be under no illusions: If we are to maintain the dynamism of the region then we must preserve the rules-based structure that has enabled it thus far. This means cooperation not unilateral actions to seize or create territory or militarise disputed areas. This means competing within the framework of international law not winning through corruption, interference or coercion.

          > Some fear that China will seek to impose a latter day Monroe Doctrine on this hemisphere in order to dominate the region, marginalising the role and contribution of other nations, in particular the United States. Such a dark view of our future would see China isolating those who stand in opposition to or are not aligned with its interests, while using its economic largesse to reward those toeing the line.

          The timeline shows that Australia’s enthusiasm for the term ‘rules-based order’ was founded on the sense that it applied ‘out there’, to countries such as China. There is an implicit assumption that Australia models the ideal rule-respecting international actor. Absent from Australian politicians’ elaborations of the term is a recognition that Australia’s own actions are not always consistent with the global rules-based order. Our policies with respect to asylum seekers, for example, breach our commitments under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol and the major human rights treaties. Our increasing reliance on ‘national security’ as a rationale for curtailing the powers of the judiciary and the media to scrutinise government action similarly breaches Australia’s international obligations.

          > Australia will continue strongly to support US global leadership.

We believe that the United States’ engagement to support a rules-based order is in its own interests and in the interests of wider international stability and prosperity.

          This White Paper remained forthright in its advocacy of a rules-based order, and made a solid pitch to connect liberal democratic values at home with a rules-based system internationally, making the argument that “our adherence to the rule of law extends beyond our borders” and “our support internationally for these values also serves to advance our national interests”. The Foreign Policy White Paper was emblematic of the worldview espoused by the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. It made good sense for a middle-sized power, a nation that cannot have its way in the world through strength alone. Still, these aspirations have been put under intense strain since then, with worsening Chinese coercion, Trump’s deep disregard both for democratic safeguards and the liberal international system, and the comprehensive strategic shock of COVID-19 that has driven a fresh fixation on sovereignty and borders.

          > The role of the power and influence of the United States in creating incentives for countries to abide by the rules cannot be overstated … Any absence of US and allied leadership within these and other institutions risks declining relevance and influence in global affairs — and others may fill the gap bringing with them a different set of values and principles, and without the necessary commitment to preserving the best of the international rules-based order.

          For a time, Australia could be accused of double standards when it came to specific elements of the rules-based order: the dispute resolution procedure under UNCLOS, to which Canberra had issued a reservation in 1994. This became relevant during protracted differences over the delimitation of the maritime boundary with East Timor. Australia’s commitment to the lawful resolution of differences was further questioned in light of allegations it had used espionage to advantage it in bilateral negotiations with East Timor in the early 2000s. Significantly, the Australian government changed its position to accept an international conciliation process over the maritime boundary in 2016, the same year that Australia supported the arbitration award favouring the Philippines with regard to China’s claims and actions in the South China Sea. Subsequently, on 6 March 2018, Australia and Timor-Leste concluded a treaty to establish their maritime boundaries. Not only was this, frankly, a just and reasonable outcome for a struggling small neighbour — it also ensured greater consistency and credibility for Australia in its advocacy of a rules-based order.

          Australia’s participation in the conciliation process with Timor-Leste that resulted in the 2018 treaty was positive and reaffirmed the significance of the UNCLOS in resolving maritime delimitation disputes. It should be noted however, that Australia unsuccessfully challenged the competence of the Conciliation Commission. Australia also faced international criticism over Timor-Leste’s claims of espionage during the negotiations of the 2006 CMATS (the treaty between the two countries on certain maritime arrangements).

          This came down to a difference of opinion with the Trump administration, where I had argued that the United States should remain in the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) to drive reform and effect change from within. The Administration determined that the HRC was beyond redemption and that attempts to improve it would inevitably fail and therefore the more dramatic step of resigning would send a stronger message.

          Allan is right, the post-war order is gone, but many of its institutions and systems remain. These are under immense pressure from anti-globalisation, populism, nationalism, and authoritarianism, from the Trump administration on one side and China on the other. Getting agreement on responses to many of our most urgent global problems — such as climate change or even fighting the COVID-19 pandemic — is harder than ever.

          Yet there will always be some form of rules-based layer to global order. Much less certain is how effective these elements of the international system will be and whose values they will reflect. In some areas, such as governance of the internet, competing systems and philosophies are emerging. Great power competition and diverging values and interests mean fault-lines are likely to continue to run through much of the multilateral, rule-setting system for the foreseeable future.

          Still, history does not always work in straight lines. We can find space to work with China within some rules-based systems, such as trade for example. America could still rediscover that its security and prosperity are enhanced when it leads by the power of its example and invests in global public goods. It does not look hopeful now, but perhaps China and the United States could emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic with a renewed understanding that even as they compete, none of the world’s major global challenges can be addressed adequately without cooperation between them.

      # Morrison Government
      ### Aug 2018&mdash;

    summary: |
      Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been compelled to grapple with President Xi’s increasingly assertive China, President Trump’s increasingly disruptive United States, and intensifying competition between the two great powers.

      In his 2019 Lowy Lecture, Mr Morrison delivered a major speech at the Lowy Institute on the RBO in which he distinguished between “positive” and “negative” globalism. He emphasised the importance of Australia playing a “more active role” in standards setting and tasked the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) to undertake “a comprehensive audit of global institutions and rule-making processes”. Since then, the government’s national security agenda has been dominated by non-traditional issues, including the unprecedented bushfires and a global pandemic.

      Australia’s call for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 and the performance of the World Health Organization refocused attention on the rules-based order and China. In June 2020, Foreign Minister Payne declared that “COVID-19 has shown that our international order is as important as ever.” Payne said the DFAT audit had found that “multilateral organisations, especially international standard-setting bodies, create rules that are vital to Australia's security, interests, values and prosperity”.

          With the government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, some questions were raised of how committed Australia would remain to the rules-based order it had long espoused. One line in the Prime Minister’s 2019 Lowy Lecture — criticising ‘negative globalism’ — became the focus of such concern. However, developments in 2020 have confirmed a continued, if modified, Australian commitment to international institutions and ‘practical multilateralism’, the theme of Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s National Security College speech in June 2020. This new approach to the rules-based order includes Australia’s efforts to propel international coordination and investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mobilise in protection of interests and values against Chinese coercion and misinformation. Part of this push involves self-selecting coalitions of democracies and middle powers as well as selective use of multilateralism. Perhaps this foreshadows a policy of international engagement with a harder edge for a darker decade — and how much of the early twenty-first century rules-based order will survive the gathering storm remains a critical question.

      #       description: |
      #         The Australian government announced several political and private-sector organisations in Australia had come under cyber-attack carried out by a “sophisticated state-based cyber-actor”, but refused to confirm which country was behind the attack. That reluctance is part of the emerging rules of this new game of cyber competition as countries struggle to develop a framework to manage growing state-on-state rivalry in the cyber realm.

          ## Prime Minister Scott Morrison's speech to the Sydney Institute

          The Prime Minister delivered an address on Australia’s foreign policy, which reiterated his government’s commitment to adhering to a rules-based order.

          Mr Morrison spoke about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action:

          > ... maintaining support for the JCPOA serves our interests in nuclear non-proliferation and in reinforcing the rules-based international system. It is consistent with Australia’s position on other non-proliferation issues … And it serves our interest in encouraging rules-based approaches to resolving other issues of international concern, including the South China Sea.

          Early in his term, Morrison had to decide whether to break with the dominant international legal view and follow the United States in recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The decision had wider implications for international norms against the acquisition of territory by force. Morrison opted for a compromise, announcing that Australia would recognise West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital but would not immediately move its embassy from Tel Aviv.

          > The starting point for their deliberation was Australia’s absolute commitment to a two-state solution, these are the guard rails, with a secure Israel and future Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. I also required that their deliberations respect Australia’s obligations under international law and UN Security Council resolutions — two things that are fundamental, I think, to Australia’s interests in a rules-based order. You can’t look at these things in isolation. Our foreign policy is guided by our fundamental interest in ensuring that internationally agreed rules continue to safeguard our security and prosperity. We don’t get to pick and choose.

          The Foreign Minister frequently referred to the importance of multilateral institutions in achieving this:

          > COVID-19 has shown that our international order is as important as ever. There is need for reform in several areas, but the pandemic has brought into stark relief the major role of international institutions in addressing and coordinating a global response to a global problem across multiple lines of effort. What has been exposed is the magnitude of the consequences if we fail to ensure these institutions are fit-for-purpose, accountable to member states, and free from undue influence.

          > ... multilateral organisations, especially international standard-setting bodies, create rules that are vital to Australia's security, interests, values and prosperity. Those bodies regulate international cooperation in key sectors of our economy including civil aviation, maritime transport, intellectual property, telecommunications, agriculture. They promote universal values and play critical roles in responding to emerging global challenges, from the regulation of cyber security and maintaining a peaceful outer space, to outbreaks of Ebola and COVID-19.

          On 1 July 2020, the Morrison government released its 2020 Defence Strategic Update and announced it would invest $270 billion over the next 10 years to “upgrade the capability and potency of the Australian Defence Force”.

          In announcing the Update, the government signalled a marked shift, towards prioritising Australia’s immediate region: “Whether it’s our Pacific Step Up, our engagement with regional neighbours, or our deepening cooperation with partners new and old, our focus must be on the Indo–Pacific — it’s where we live and where our interests are.”

          The Update emphasised the need for Australia to develop its own deterrent capabilities and to seek international partnerships outside of the United States.

          ## Linda Reynolds ASPI Address, Launch of 2020 Defence Strategic Update

          In her speech launching the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, Linda Reynolds outlined why Australia needs to develop a more potent and offensive defence force to effectively counter future threats.

          > ... [the] future is now. And the Government and Defence must respond.

          Responding to this new threat environment, Minister Reynolds announced the government’s commitment to pursue three new Defence objectives: shape, deter, and respond. Ms Reynolds emphasised that these new objectives will be centred on maintaining a stable, rules-based order in our immediate region.

          > Our updated strategy — prioritises Defence’s engagement in our region, the Indo–Pacific. This is where shaping is key. It is where we work even closer with our regional friends to ensure a stable, prosperous and rules-based region. One in which the sovereignty of all states, large and small, is respected.

          ## Scott Morrison, Aspen Security Forum Address

          The Prime Minister used his address, entitled 'Tomorrow in the Indo-Pacific' to share the strategic assessment that drove Australia’s Defence Strategic Update.

          He noted that the deteriorating strategic situation had led some to “fret about the weakening of the rules-based international order. Fair enough.” He underlined Australia’s support for “international engagement framed by agreed rules and norms, not crude economic or political coercion.”

          As well as urging China to accept “broader strategic responsibility”, he encouraged both Washington and Beijing to commit to “rules-based economic interaction.”

          Mr Morrison adopted the concept of “international society”, formulated by Anglo-Australian scholar Hedley Bull to frame his address, citing Bull’s 1977 book, _The Anarchical Society_, and referring to Bull himself six times throughout the address. Mr Morrison used this concept to expand on his concerns about sovereignty and “negative globalism”. He also referred to Robert Kagan’s 2018 book, _The Jungle Grows Back_.

          On Bull and his concept of “international society”:

          > Hedley Bull, whose 1977 work, The Anarchical Society, remains one of the most influential works on global politics of the last half century … Bull coined the notion of ‘a society of states’ or ‘international society’ – said to exist when sovereign nations consider themselves to be ‘bound by a common set of rules in their relations and share in the working of common institutions.

          On multilateral institutions and “negative globalism”:

          > As Hedley Bull argued, [multilateral institutions] are symptoms of a well-functioning society of states, not the cause.  When global institutions and their bureaucracies become unaccountable, when they become vulnerable to manipulation or coercion, when they lose the confidence of their membership, they fail in their task to help the sovereign nations that establish them agree a common sets of rules to guide their relationships. In my Lowy Institute speech nearly a year ago, I described that trend as negative globalism. And my view hasn’t changed.  As I said and repeat now, we believe in a positive globalism, where nations like Australia engage directly with others, as equal, sovereign nations, in the pursuit of common objectives through these fora.

          On the US-China rivalry:

          > Together, China and the United States have a special responsibility to uphold what Bull described as ‘the common set of rules’ that build an international society. Now, that means respecting international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes, including trade disputes. It means a commitment to rules-based economic interaction. Neither coercion nor abdication from the international system is the way forward…We must tend that garden and we must rebuild Bull’s ‘international society’ anew.
