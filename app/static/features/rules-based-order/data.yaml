        val: Rudd's first visit to Washington as prime minister included a speech at the Brookings Institution replete with references to world order, including the first known use of 'rules-based order' by an Australian Prime Minister-based order&#58;
      - format: q
        val: The idea of a "harmonious world" depends on China being a participant in the world order and, along with others, acting in accordance with the rules of that order…we look to China to make a strong contribution to strengthening the global and regional rules-based order.

    content:
      - format: p
        val: In Rudd's inaugural National Security Statement, the rules-based order is listed as one of the five principles of Australia's national security&#58;
      - format: ol
        val: 1.	Maintaining Australia's territorial and border integrity.<br>2.	Promoting Australia's political sovereignty<br>3.	Preserving Australia's cohesive and resilient society and the long-term strengths of our economy.<br>4.	Protecting Australians and Australian interests both at home and abroad<br>5.	Promoting an international environment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, that is stable, peaceful and prosperous, together with a global rules based order which enhances Australia's national interests.
      - format: p
        val: Rudd also said&#58;
      - format: q
        val: At the global level, we are committed to multilateral institutions, and in particular the United Nations, to promote a rules based international order that enhances our security and economy. We believe those that share the benefits of these systems must also share the responsibilities of supporting and enhancing them.

    title: Defence White Paper
    content:
      - format: p
        val: Maintaining the rules-based order is referenced as one of the options Government can use when contemplating the use of military power&#58;
      - format: q
        val: ... the ADF has to be prepared to contribute to military contingencies in the rest of the world, in support of efforts by the international community to uphold global security and a rules-based international order, where our interests align and where we have the capacity to do so.
      - format: p
        val: In particular, defence of the rules-based order is cited as a justification for humanitarian intervention&#58;
      - format: q
        val: For a rules-based global security order to work, occasionally it is necessary to act to restore order. Within the UN context, the 'responsibility to protect' principle, which is currently at an important stage of development, holds that states are responsible for the protection of their own citizens from mass atrocities, and that the international community should encourage and assist states to exercise that authority. Australia supports the principle, and recognises that, on occasion, it may be necessary for other states to intervene, under the auspices of a UN Security Council resolution, if a state cannot or will not protect its population.
      - format: p
        val: The rules-based order concept is also used to link Australia’s local, regional and global interests&#58;
      - format: q
        val: These strategic interests are presented in geographical terms, as a hierarchy that reflects both relative priorities for action from a defence planning perspective, and our realistic capacity for influence through the employment of military power. They are interlocking - a stable rules-based global security order increases the likelihood of strategic stability in the Asia-Pacific region, which in turn makes more likely the maintenance of a secure immediate neighbourhood and ultimately a secure Australia.

    title: June/July 2010, Stuxnet attack
    content:
      - format: p
        val: Widely understood to be a cyber weapon jointly developed by the United States and Israel, Stuxnet is the world's first digital weapon. In 2010, it was responsible for causing substantial damage to the nuclear program of Iran by targeting the centrifuges used to enrich uranium gas at the Natanz enrichment plant. Ralph Langner, the German cybersecurity expert who discovered Stuxnet, said the attack "could be considered a textbook example of a 'just war' approach. It didn’t kill anyone. That’s a good thing. But I am afraid this is only a short-term view. In the long run it has opened Pandora’s box."

        val: <b>17 December 2010, attempted suicide of Mohamed Bouazizi</b><br/>On 17 December 2010, Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi self-immolated, sparking a series of protests against poor economic management and political autocracy that would topple many governments in the Middle East. The Arab Spring – as it came to be known – was a loosely related group of pro-democracy uprisings that enveloped several largely Muslim countries and resulted in regime change in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and brutal civil wars in Syria and Yemen.
      - format: p
        val: <b>March 2011, Libya UN Resolution 1973</b><br/>Early in the Arab Spring, Libya attracted international condemnation over its government’s indiscriminate and disproportionate use of military force against protesters. On 17 March 2011, the UN Security Council passed a resolution authorising "all necessary measures" to protect civilians in Libya from pro-Gaddafi forces. UNSCR 1973 included the declaration of a no-fly zone over Libya, but specifically excluded a UN-mandated occupying ground force.

    title: Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd's address to the Oxford Business Alumni Forum
    content:
      - format: p
        val: Rudd warns that "The worst outcome that you could ever imagine for a country like Australia, is that there be conflict or war between the United States and China", and argues that the development of a rules-based order is a race against time&#58;
      - format: q
        val: We began to debate two or three years ago on how we could build an Asia Pacific community in a region which doesn't have regional institutions capable of bringing around the table the Americans, the Chinese and the rest of us, on how we craft the rules of the game for this region, for the next half-century. Because if you fail to do that, and to cultivate and to develop a culture, and have it of economic and security policy and foreign policy cooperation, it is very easy to drift in the reverse direction.

      - format: p
        val: This document did not have a major focus on security. Notably, on two occasions it argues that Australia should play a part in increasing the role of Asian countries in the rules-based order&#58;
      - format: q
        val: Australia's future is irrevocably tied to the stability and sustainable security of our diverse region…We will continue to support a greater role for Asian countries in a rules-based regional and global order. Australia's alliance with the United States and a strong US presence in Asia will support regional stability, as will China's full participation in regional developments.

    content:

        val: In Prime Minister Gillard's launch statement for the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, the rules-based order becomes specifically 'regional'&#58;
      - format: q
        val: At the same time, all countries in the region, particularly the major powers, have a deep interest in strategic stability. So we need not be pessimistic - but just as we work to shape the economic future of our region, so too do we work to shape our security environment.<br/><br/>We are supporting the stabilising presence of the United States, a strong Defence Force, building habits of trust and co-operation in our region and a rules-based regional order. We have an ally in Washington - respect in Beijing - and more.

    title: National Security Strategy
    content:
      - format: p
        val: The National Security Strategy itself contains 7 references to 'rules-based', but all in the context of the global order, rather than regional. The role of the US is considered central to maintenance of the rules-based order&#58;
      - format: q
        val: The United States is integral to global economic growth and security, and provides the critical underpinning to the rules-based order that exists today.
      - format: p
        val: Adherence to the rules-based order is characterised as a reflection of Australian values and history&#58;
      - format: q
        val: The rule of law provides the framework in which government balances its responsibility to protect Australia, its people and its interests while preserving our civil liberties. These values influence our foreign and defence policy. Our values underpin our reputation as a responsible member of the international community, committed to a rules-based global order.

    title: Defence White Paper
    content:
      - format: p
        val: References to the rules-based order in this White Paper are made largely in geographic terms. Australia's primary strategic interest is defence of the continent, followed by a secure region, and finally a rules-based order. As with the 2009 Defence White Paper, this document describes the UN as central to maintaining a global rules-based order&#58;
      - format: q
        val: Both in and beyond Southeast Asia, Australia supports a rules-based regional security order that fosters cooperation, eases tensions between states and provides incentives to major powers like China and India to rise peacefully. In particular, it is in our interests that no hostile power in the Indo-Pacific is able to coerce or intimidate others through force or the threat of force.

    title: 2013-2016&#58; The long absence of the rules-based order
    content:
      - format: p
        val: Our quantitative study reveals that between 2013 and 2016 - coinciding largely with Tony Abbott’s prime ministership - there was a significant decrease in the number of references to a rules-based order in speeches and policy statements by the Australian government.
      - format: p
        val: The partial exception was Julie Bishop who, in October 2013, less than four weeks into her role as Australia's new Foreign Minister, gave an address to the Japan National Press Club in which she spoke about Japan and Australia being part of a "community of nations" that "have an interest in a stable, predictable, rules-based order – both around the world, and specifically in Asia." In November 2013, Bishop gave a speech in Washington, DC linking the rules-based order to international trade.
      - format: p
        val: These two references by Bishop represent the few instances in which the concept of a rules-based order was used in Australia’s political lexicon between 2013 and 2016. Our study found that during his time as Prime Minister (September 2013 to September 2015), Tony Abbott did not use the term at all in key speeches.

        val: There are 56 references to the 'rules based' order in this White Paper, which explicitly points to Russia and North Korea as challenges to the order, and also lists terrorism, piracy, and people smugglers as other risks.
      - format: p
        val: The definition of the rules-based order in this White Paper stresses the capacity for evolution in the order, and argues that the order has become more important due to 'growing interconnectivity'&#58;
      - format: q
        val: The stability of the rules-based global order is essential for Australia’s security and prosperity. A rules-based global order means a shared commitment by all countries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules which evolve over time, such as international law and regional security arrangements. This shared commitment has become even more important with growing interconnectivity, which means that events across the world have the potential to affect Australia's security and prosperity. The Government is committed to making practical and effective military contributions to global security operations to maintain the rules-based order and address shared security challenges where it is in our interest to do so.
      - format: p
        val: The US is described as being central to the stability of the rules-based order&#58;
      - format: q
        val: The global strategic and economic weight of the United States will be essential to the continued stability of the rules-based global order on which Australia relies for our security and prosperity. The world will continue to look to the United States for leadership in global security affairs and to lead military coalitions that support international security and the rules-based global order.

        val: This Tribunal, as you know, is established in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is a codification of international maritime law. It was established so that countries can resolve disputes peacefully in accordance with international law. The UN convention on the Law of the Sea, and the Arbitral Tribunal are absolutely crucial elements of the international rules based order which underpins peace, stability and prosperity around the world but especially in our part of the world for decades. All of us, all countries large and small have benefitted enormously from this system which facilitates trade and enables disputes to be resolved in accordance with rules rather than by coercive means.

      - format: q
        val: <p>The importance of liberal values and institutions should not be underestimated or ignored.</p><p>While non-democracies such as China can thrive when participating in the present system, an essential pillar of our preferred order is democratic community.</p><p>Domestic democratic habits of negotiating and compromise are essential to powerful countries resolving their disagreements according to international law and rules.</p><p>History also shows democracy and democratic institutions are essential for nations if they are to reach their economic potential.</p><p>The only countries in the world who have escaped the 'middle-income' trap to become wealthy, high-income and advanced economies are democracies –with the exception of a small number of oil-rich Middle Eastern states.</p><p>Liberal-democratic institutions such as rule-of-law rather than rule by executive privilege, civilian control of the military, independent and competent courts, protection of property and intellectual property rights from state appropriation or theft, and limitations on the role of the state in commercial and social affairs remain the prerequisites for stable and prosperous societies, as they are for the creation of a vibrant and innovative private sector.</p><p>While it is appropriate for different states to discover their own pathway leading toward political reform, history shows that embrace of liberal democratic institutions is the most successful foundation for nations seeking economic prosperity and social stability.</p><p>Australia is an active and vocal advocate of the liberal rules based order because the continuation of the long and prosperous peace depend on it.</p>
