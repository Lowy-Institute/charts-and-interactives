    Australia is a growing nation with a sizable migrant population, but the
    issue of how many migrants to take and where to take them from has been
    long contested. With our sustained population growth year on year made
    possible by immigrants, successive governments have had to balance the
    clear economic and social benefits of migration with concerns about
    overcrowding and service delivery.

            The Liberal Party has pledged to cap permanent migration at 160,000
            a year for the next four years, the previous cap was 190,000. In
            addition it will introduce a new skilled worker visa program for
            23,000 migrants requiring them to spend 3 years in regional
            Australia to earn permanent residency.  Redistributing migrants to
            regional Australia to reduce congestion in major cities has been a
            major Coalition policy.

            The Labor Party attempts to balance the need for skilled migrants
            with a focus on attempting to train domestic workers first. It
            states that Permanent migrants provide a stable, effective and
            targeted source of skilled workers‚Äù Labor has also pledged to
            progressively increase the annual refugee intake to 27,000. This
            number might eventually rise to 32,000 with the expansion of a
            community sponsorship program.
