    Australia’s diplomatic footprint is comprised of the diplomats and
    officials we have posted overseas and the ‘soft power’ our nation
    can bring to bear. A larger footprint provides greater influence
    and access for Australian officials, businesses and citizens. The
    Liberal and Labor parties have both committed to increasing
    Australia’s diplomatic footprint, particularly in the Pacific.

            The Liberal Party has promised to increase the nation’s 
            diplomatic footprint as part of its pivot to the Pacific.

            The Labor party has also committed to establishing four new posts
            in the Indo&#8209;Pacific, as well as establishing
            ‘Geo&#8209;economic counsellors’ at key locations in the diplomatic
            network.

            Australia’s diplomatic footprint is relatively small for its size –
            a 2017 Lowy [Global Diplomacy Index] rated our footprint as just
            below Pakistan’s.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has
            been underfunded for several years with limited government
            investment.

              Australia is a globally-engaged trading nation, geographically
              distant from its largest trading and security partners including
              the United States, Europe and China. Diplomacy – building
              relationships with important partners and neighbours around the
              world is therefore critical to its success. Yet Australia
              remains a disproportionately small diplomatic power for a country
              of its economic weight and wealth. It has one of the smallest
              diplomatic networks in the developed world, ranking behind
              Belgium, Hungary, Portugal, Chile and Greece – all far smaller
              nations with economies and populations a fraction the size of
              Australia's.
              
              The current Coalition Government has made a concerted effort to
              increase Australia's diplomatic footprint, adding eight new posts
              and increasing Australia's network to 118 posts worldwide.
              However, this remains well below the G20 average of 194 posts and
              the OECD average of 132 posts (from the latest data in the 2017
              Global Diplomacy Index).
              
              Since its 2009 report on Australia's 'diplomatic deficit', the
              Lowy Institute has consistently argued that this thinned-out
              diplomatic network is the result of decades of government neglect
              and under-resourcing of Australia's diplomacy. Despite the small
              increase in the network, the number of staff at those overseas
              posts (869) is almost 10 per cent smaller than it was thirty
              years ago (948), and  DFAT funding has largely stagnated. It is
              continually asked to do more with less.
