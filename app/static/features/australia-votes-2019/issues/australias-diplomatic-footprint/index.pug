    Australia’s diplomatic footprint is comprised of the diplomats and
    officials we have posted overseas and the ‘soft power’ our nation
    can bring to bear. A larger footprint provides greater influence
    and access for Australian officials, businesses and citizens. The
    Liberal and Labor parties have both committed to increasing
    Australia’s diplomatic footprint, particularly in the Pacific.

              The Liberal Party has promised to increase the nation’s 
              diplomatic footprint as part of its pivot to the Pacific.

            The Labor party has also committed to establishing four new posts
            in the Indo&#8209;Pacific, as well as establishing
            ‘Geo&#8209;economic counsellors’ at key locations in the diplomatic
            network.

            Australia’s diplomatic footprint is relatively small for its size –
            a 2017 Lowy Global Diplomacy Index rated our footprint as just
            below Pakistan’s.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has
            been underfunded for several years with limited government
            investment.
