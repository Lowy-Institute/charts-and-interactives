            The Liberal Party has committed to reducing emissions via a
            competition policy using various government funds and agencies
            setup to reduce emissions by investment, loans and grants.  The
            part is aiming for an emissions reduction of 26-28% below 2005
            levels.  The Liberals have also highlighted Australia’s success in
            meeting or exceeding the Kyoto protocol targets. Countries earn
            credits for exceeding the emissions targets at Kyoto that can then
            be carried forward to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets.

            The Labor Party has highlighted some government bodies it could use
            to reduce emissions, as part of its climate policy. It has also put
            forward a 45% target for electricity emissions by 2030.  It has
            also been reported that a Labor government will effectively
            introduce a “baseline and credit” emissions credit scheme if
            elected. The party’s plan includes lowering the current government
            emissions cap of 100,000 tonnes of carbon per year to 25,000
            tonnes. This is estimated to affect 250 businesses, up from the 140
            businesses the cap currently covers.   The Labor Party has
            expressed hesitancy on using any Australian credits from the Kyoto
            Protocol to meet the Paris Climate Agreements.

            Unsurprisingly, the Australian Greens are aiming for net zero, or
            even negative emissions by 2040, as well as binding national
            emissions targets and a moratorium on new coal and gas power
            stations.

              We all remember Kevin Rudd declaring climate change “the most
              urgent moral challenge of our generation”. It was 2007, and as
              foreign as the concept may seem today, Australia had had the same
              Prime Minister for 11 years.

              At that time, the annual Lowy Institute Poll found that 68% of
              Australians believed global warming was a serious and pressing
              problem, and that we should begin taking steps now, even if this
              involves significant costs. Rudd swept to power with a promise to
              introduce a comprehensive emissions trading scheme.

              But as the drought eased, concerns about climate change waned.
              Rudd’s government lost momentum on emissions legislation and he
              was rolled as Prime Minister. By the time Julia Gillard had
              legislated a price on carbon, the belief that global warming was
              a “serious and pressing problem” had almost halved (36% in 2012).
               
              Climate-sceptic Tony Abbott was elected in 2013 and repealed
              Gillard’s carbon price. Drought conditions also returned to
              Australia in 2013. These events coincide with support for climate
              action rebounding. By 2018, 59% of Australians said steps should
              be taken to address global warming, even at significant cost.

              Australia has been mired in political debates about energy
              security, electricity supply and a once-bipartisan-now-dead
              National Energy Guarantee. The majority of Australians (84%)
              believe the government should focus on renewables, even if this
              means we may need to invest in more infrastructure to make the
              system more reliable (2018).

              In the 2018 Lowy Institute Poll, Australians ranked climate
              change as the third most critical threat to Australia, only
              behind international terrorism and North Korea’s nuclear
              programs. Schoolkids are striking and #climateelection is
              trending. Support for action may not have yet returned to its
              2006 high, but climate change will again be a major election
              issue in 2019.
