            The Liberals have not expressed much interest in increasing our
            foreign aid. The then Minister for International Development and
            the Pacific, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells was quoted as that
            the majority of Australians do not support spending any more on
            foreign aid.

            Currently Australian aid is at an all-time low, having been slashed dramatically from 2013-2014 when it was 0.37% of gross national income or $5.7b and now makes up only 0.22% of gross national income. The international average is 0.31%.

            The Labor Party has promised to roll back some of the more recent
            Liberal aid cuts and then increase Australian aid spending every
            year under a Labor government.

            On average Australians believe that 14% of the national budget is
            spent on aid, and that 10% should be spent on aid. Australia’s aid
            budget is approximately 0.8% of the federal budget.

              Australia’s aid program has always had an electoral challenge –
              it’s simply not a vote winner. Not enough Australians care or
              understand its value. So in the absence of any definitive
              election statement about its future aid program, the Coalition
              Government’s actions since coming to power in 2013 – abolition of
              the aid program’s expert agency and decimation of the aid budget
              – are the best indicators of what their future aid program would
              look like.  Dismal, if you do appreciate its national interest
              and humanitarian value.

              The Greens say they are aiming for an aid budget which is the
              unreachable 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) – a UN target
              since 1970 that has been aspired to by many nations but achieved
              by only a handful in almost 50 years. It is a straw man promise
              appealing to ideal rather than the possible.

              The ALP has seized the raiding of the aid budget under the
              Coalition Government as an opportunity to present itself as the
              aid program’s champion by promising to reverse the downward
              spiral and increase the budget/GNI ratio every year it is in
              office. Arguably an easy promise because such a turn around
              would not require much, if any budget pain, particularly if they
              return to the Rudd Government’s approach of promising the big
              increases in the rolling forward estimates, like some tantalizing
              mirage. As for a target, there is none; not even a return to the
              Rudd/Gillard Government promises of a 0.5%/GNI target – also
              never reached.
              
              But where the ALP does stand out is its recognition of the
              deleterious effect of the Abbott Government’s abolition of the
              aid agency on the quality of the aid program.  While not
              promising to resurrect the dead and buried AusAID, there is a
              commitment to rebuild the development capability of the officials
              responsible for managing the program.
