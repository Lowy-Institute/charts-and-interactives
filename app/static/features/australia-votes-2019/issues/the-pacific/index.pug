block intro-description

    The Pacific Islands is a region unique to Australia’s national interest. In
    no other part of the world does Australia wield more influence or carry
    such a heavy burden of history. The Pacific is also unique for its
    development challenges. Small size and remoteness, compounded by climate
    change and rapid population growth, will ensure that Australia’s support is
    needed for years to come. The entrance of new partners, particularly China,
    has put the Pacific back towards the centre of Australian foreign 
    policy&nbsp;thinking.

            In an effort to reassert Australia’s position as the ‘partner of
            choice’ in the region, and to dissuade China from investments that
            threaten Australia’s strategic interests, the government has
            announced more resources for the Pacific. It will allocate 35% of
            all Australian foreign aid ($1.4 billion) to the Pacific.
            Investments will include a $2 billion infrastructure lending
            facility and a $1 billion capital guarantee to Australia’s Export
            Finance and Insurance Corporation. The government will also open
            new diplomatic missions and a Pacific office within DFAT. In March
            2019 Australia and PNG signed an agreement to build a joint naval
            base on PNG’s Manus Island.

            Speaking at the Lowy Institute in 2018, Opposition Leader Bill
            Shorten said that Labor supported an increased focus on the region.
            It is unlikely any of the recent government announcements would be
            reversed or changed markedly under a Shorten government. Climate
            change policy, both domestically and in the Pacific, stands out as
            a major point of difference. The Labor Party will push for a
            Pacific Bank instead of an infrastructure lending&nbsp;facility.

            The Pacific is back at the centre of Australian foreign policy
            thinking, with China’s increasing interest and investment in the
            region the driving force. Pacific politicians and analysts have been
            talking about China for more than a decade, but the newfound
            intensity of attention focused on the region in the past six months
            is both unprecedented and welcome.
            
            However, the new emphasis upsets some Pacific pundits and
            politicians who say that too much talking is being done over the
            heads of Pacific Islanders, and that Pacific agency to manage its
            own affairs is underestimated. These are legitimate concerns.
            
            There are also clear risks for Australia. One is the breakneck pace
            of new announcements, which will make implementation challenging in
            a part of the world where Australia struggles to manage what it is
            already doing. Another is consistency. The Pacific has seen this
            kind of attention from Australia before, only for it to fade
            quickly. Scott Morrison said, “to step up you’ve got to show
            up”.<sup>[3]</sup> Will the next government show up?
            
            Then there is the Pacific problem Australia would prefer not to talk
            about: climate change. The Boe Declaration on Regional Security
            calls climate change (not China) the “single greatest threat” to the
            Pacific.<sup>[4]</sup> On climate, Australia has too often been at
            odds with Pacific Island countries instead of championing their
            case.
            
            Despite these risks and frustrations, the renewed focus on the
            region is likely to continue into the 46th parliament, regardless of
            who forms government.
