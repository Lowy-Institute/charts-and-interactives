            The 2018-2019 budget provided $36.4 billion for the defence
            department. Over the past year both major parties have committed 
            to eventually increase that number, raising Australian defence
            spending to 2% of GDP. There has been significant focus on
            increasing the domestic defence industry, with politicians
            spruiking the creation and maintenance of Australian jobs.

            The Liberal Party [has committed][1] to increasing defence funding
            to 2% of GDP and building up Australia’s domestic defence industry.
            A big focus has been on increasing the capabilities of the
            Australian navy while trying to construct most of the ships
            locally. Israel’s defence industry has been cited as a positive
            example.

              The French state-owned company will produce 12 diesel-electric
              submarines for the Australian navy. The new submarines are needed
              to replace the aging Collins class submarines.

            The Labor Party [is committed][1] to maintaining defence spending
            at 2% which was reaffirmed by its leader the Honourable Bill
            Shorten late last year. He cited developing a national defence
            industry as giving the nation the ability to project power and to
            be taken seriously.

            Australia produces the Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle for
            troop transport to combat areas. It is the first armoured vehicle
            to be fully designed and manufactured domestically in over sixty
            years. The bushmaster has seen extensive service in Iraq and
            Afghanistan and has been exported to the Netherlands and the United
            Kingdom.

              The bipartisan commitment to higher defence spending is welcome,
              but Australia wastes too much money on non-essential
              capabilities.
              
              Chinese maritime power is growing and America’s is declining.
              Growing Chinese influence in Australia’s neighbourhood is
              inevitable, but our defence focus should be on ensuring that
              Southeast Asia and the Pacific can never be dominated by Chinese
              military power.
              
              Australia also needs to think about how it manages competition
              with China if America decides it does not want to compete. Higher
              spending would be necessary in those circumstances, but not
              sufficient. We need closer friendships in the region, and there
              is no more important partner than Indonesia.
