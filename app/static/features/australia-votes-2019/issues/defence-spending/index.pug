    The 2019–2020 budget provides $38.7 billion for the Defence Department.
    Both major parties have committed to increase spending to 2% of GDP. There
    has been significant focus on growing the domestic defence industry,
    particularly ship-building. In January 2018 the Turnbull government
    committed to making Australia a “top ten” global defence exporter.

            The Liberal–National Coalition has committed to increasing defence
            funding to 2% of GDP and building up Australia’s domestic defence
            industry to match. A big focus has been on increasing the
            capabilities of the Australian Navy while trying to construct more
            ships locally. The Coalition has also committed to developing a
            naval base on Manus Island and increasing military cooperation with
            Papua New Guinea.

              The French state-owned company will produce 12 diesel-electric
              submarines for the Australian navy. The new submarines are needed
              to replace the aging Collins class submarines.

            The Australian Labor Party is committed to increasing defence
            spending to 2% of GDP by 2021–22, a goal that was reaffirmed by
            leader Bill Shorten in late 2018. In response to questions at a
            Lowy Institute address, Mr Shorten referred to this pledge as
            “fundamental”. He has also said that developing a national defence
            industry gives Australia the ability to project power and meant it
            would be taken seriously.

            Australia produces the Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle for
            troop transport to combat areas. It is the first armoured vehicle
            to be fully designed and manufactured domestically in over sixty
            years. The bushmaster has seen extensive service in Iraq and
            Afghanistan and has been exported to the Netherlands and the United
            Kingdom.

              The bipartisan commitment to higher defence spending is welcome,
              but Australia wastes too much money on non-essential
              capabilities.

              China’s maritime power is growing and America’s is declining.
              Rising Chinese influence in Australia’s neighbourhood is
              inevitable, but our defence focus should be on ensuring that
              Southeast Asia and the Pacific can never be dominated by Chinese
              military power.

              Australia also needs to think about how it manages competition
              with China if America decides it does not want to compete. Higher
              spending would be necessary in those circumstances, but not
              sufficient. We need closer friendships in the region, and there
              is no more important partner than Indonesia.
