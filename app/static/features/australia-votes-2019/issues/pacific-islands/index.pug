    The Pacific Islands is a region unique to Australia’s national interest. It
    is Australia’s immediate region. In no other part of the world does
    Australia wield more influence and agency, or carry the most baggage. The
    Pacific is unique for its development challenges. Small size and
    remoteness, compounded by climate change and rapid population growth, will
    ensure the need for Australia’s support for years to come. The entrance of
    new partners, particularly China, has put the Pacific back in the centre of
    Australian foreign policy thinking.

            2018 has seen increasing importance attached to the Pacific islands
            by the Liberal party. The coalition government made a multi-billion
            dollar pledge to a regional infrastructure fund, export assurance,
            security and the opening of new embassies in the region.

            Labor argues that the Pacific is crucial to Australia’s future and
            supports an increased Australian presence in the area. However, it
            has noted that climate change policy is heavily tied into any
            pacific policy given the danger it poses to low lying island
            nations.

              The Pacific has vaulted back to the centre of Australian foreign
              policy thinking. The spectre of China is the driving force behind
              this, but Pacific politicians and analysts have been talking
              about China in the region for more than a decade. We have reached
              a tipping point, and attention focused on the region in the last
              six months is both unprecedented and welcome.
              
              The new geostrategic focus on the region ruffles feathers among
              Pacific pundits and politicians who say that too much talking is
              being done over the heads of Pacific Islanders, and that Pacific
              agency to manage its own affairs is underestimated. These are
              legitimate concerns.
              
              There are also clear risks for Australia. The breakneck pace of
              new announcements will make implementation challenging in a part
              of the world where Australia struggles to manage what it is
              already doing. Another will be consistency. The Pacific has seen
              this kind of attention from Australia before, only for it to fade
              away very quickly. Scott Morrison said, “to step up you’ve got to
              show up”. Will that carry through to the next government?
              
              And there is the elephant in the room for Australia in the
              Pacific: climate change. The Boe Declaration on security calls
              climate change, (not China), the ‘single greatest threat’ to the
              Pacific. Australia has far too often been on the wrong side of
              the table from the Pacific instead of championing their cause on
              climate.
              
              Despite these risks and frustrations, the renewed focus on the
              region is likely to continue into the 46th parliament, no matter
              who forms government.
