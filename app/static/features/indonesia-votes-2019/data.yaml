  On April 17, Indonesia is holding one of the most complicated elections the
  world has ever seen – and it all takes place in a single day. In the world’s
  third most populous democracy, there are more than 245,000 candidates
  competing for 20,000 seats in the national parliament and local legislatures.
  Incumbent Joko Widodo takes on long-time rival Prabowo Subianto in a replay
  of the 2014 race. Jokowi, as the president is known, is the favourite
  according to opinion polls.
