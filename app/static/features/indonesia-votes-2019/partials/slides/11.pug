          While Indonesia upholds the principle of secret ballots and one 
          person, one vote, some parts of Papua are still allowed to choose 
          candidates using the using the ‘noken’ communal voting&nbsp;system.

          Villagers are meant to put their choice for candidate into a 
          traditional noken bag held by the village head. But in practice, the 
          village head often decides where all the votes will&nbsp;go.
