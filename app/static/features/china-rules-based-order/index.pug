        p.hide.slide-up.ease-out China’s growing economic and military power has prompted urgent questions about its approach to the rules-based international order, which can be loosely defined as a shared commitment to conduct international affairs in accordance with laws, principles and practices embodied in institutions such as the <cite data-graph="un-leadership">United Nations</cite> and its <cite data-graph="peacekeeping-participation">peacekeeping missions</cite>, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. On the one hand, China could be expected to have a stake in maintaining the existing order which, after all, has provided the stability necessary for the country’s rise. On the other hand, it cannot be assumed that China supports all elements of the current order, which Beijing claims it had <cite data-graph="prc-organisations">no hand in creating</cite>.&ensp;

        #read-more.ease-out.max-h-0
          p Key components of the rules-based order were established by the United States as the dominant power after the Second World War. Hopes that China would peacefully integrate into the existing order were boosted when China acceded to the <cite data-graph="wto">World Trade Organization</cite> in 2001. But a much stronger China, led by President Xi Jinping since 2013, has shown increased willingness to disregard international norms, most notably in the South China Sea. 
          p To interpret and explain these issues, we asked a select group of experts about Beijing’s goals for the international order and the changes it seeks. Recognising that China’s approach to the rules-based order is closely tied to its relationship with the United States, we also asked our experts what compromises China might agree to.
          p This Lowy Institute feature presents the experts’ responses to these questions and their reactions to one another’s arguments.&ensp;
