              Every viral pandemic has its prime targets. For HIV/AIDS, it has been the marginalised and stigmatised, killing 35 million in the last 35 years. For COVID 19, it is initially the aged and physically vulnerable. But when the frontline shifts it will be the world's poor in developing countries who will suffer the most. 

              Thanks to their existing ill health, the poor in developing nations already live 18 fewer years than people in high-income countries. They have sub-standard health systems unable to provide even basic services, weak and mismanaged national economies, limited access to financial and skilled human resources, and under-educated populations.
              COVID 19 will therefore disproportionately hit the world's poorer countries both as a health cataclysm and as a destablising social and economic crisis. This will take some into the realm of fragile states and those already fragile, deeper into dysfunctionality.

              The UN Development Program <a href="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2020/COVID19_Crisis_in_developing_countries_threatens_devastate_economies.html">estimates</a> that &ldquo;income losses are expected to exceed USD220 billion across developing countries&rdquo;, hitting those least able to cope. That forecast takes on a razor edge when considering that up to 75 per cent of people in least developed countries lack access to that most primary means of infection prevention - soap and water. Many of those least developed countries are in our neighbourhood, including Cambodia, Nepal, and four Pacific countries &ndash; Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tuvalu and Kiribati.

              Even in the more prosperous parts of the developing world, the World Bank has <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/03/30/east-asia-and-pacific-countries-must-act-now-to-mitigate-economic-shock-of-covid-19">estimated</a> that if regional growth slows only to 2.1 per cent, nearly 24 million more people will remain in poverty in 2020 than would have before the COVID 19 pandemic struck. In a lower growth scenario, millions more will descend into poverty.

              The Bank acknowledges the perils in making predictions in this fast-moving crisis. Just as the world's richer countries face varying degrees of success and failure according to their response to this viral blitzkrieg, so too will developing countries. What is clear is that there must be a multi-pronged program of support, including direct assistance for health systems as well as support for failing economies. No single response fits all. Instead, this is the time to apply the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/countries/afghanistan/the10fragilestatesprinciples.htm">fragile states principles</a>, which were developed in the early 2000s to help failed states emerge from conflict &ndash; RAMSI in the Solomons was an example. These include focusing on the context, prioritising prevention, agreeing on practical co-ordination mechanisms between international actors, and staying engaged long enough to give success a chance.

              The wealthier countries and international organisations have already started galvanising resources for the poorer nations. At the G20's meeting last month, <a href="https://de.ambafrance.org/COVID-19-G20-Leaders-Statement">commitments</a> were made to strengthen capacity building and technical assistance and mobilise development and humanitarian assistance. Separately, the World Bank has put together a US$160m package of immediate and longer term support; the International Monetary Fund will engage with the private sector to help companies continue operating and sustain jobs; and the Asian Development Bank has put together a US$6.5b package for developing country members. So far, Australia's international focus is largely on the Pacific with existing aid programs being redirected to focus support on health services and mitigate the economic shock.

              It's too early to know how extensively COVID 19 will hit the developing world but the forecast is grim. The big challenge for its development partners will be funding the scale of resources needed to deal with it. Despite the commitments to date, as the developed world goes into deeper debt to save itself, governments will be forced by their electorates to make some very tough decisions about their foreign aid budgets.
