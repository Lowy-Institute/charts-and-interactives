      In its response to the 9/11 attacks, the United States undermined the rules-based international order that it had established after the Second World War and which fundamentally reflected its power, principles and preferences.

      The 9/11 attacks were launched from Afghanistan. But Iraq also came into the crosshairs over claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction — allegations that were later proven to be false. Unable to gain the agreement of the United Nations Security Council, the United States led a Coalition of the Willing (which included both the United Kingdom and Australia) to war with Iraq — an invasion that the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described as illegal and in breach of the UN Charter.

      President George W. Bush asserted that America’s liberty depended on the liberty of others — because repressive states produce terrorists. Spreading democracy became a national security imperative to remove the conditions that foster terrorism. The cornerstone of Bush’s Freedom Agenda was to be the transformation of Iraq into a democracy. The architects of the Iraq war envisaged it would lead to a new regional democratic order and peace with Israel.

      However, in order to set Iraq on new democratic foundations, the US-led Coalition dissolved Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Party and dismissed the security institutions. In so doing, it unintentionally created a power vacuum, leading to a breakdown in social order and Iraq’s descent into civil war.

      In its obsessive hunt to eradicate terrorists and prevent further attacks, the United States held thousands without due process, tortured detainees in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, kidnapped suspects in one country and sent them via extraordinary rendition to another, and sanctioned assassinations even in countries where it was not at war.

      The Iraq war mobilised a new generation of jihadis with a vision not of democracy but of a caliphate. Among the chaos, al-Qaeda established itself in Iraq. Its successor, ISIS, took advantage of the refusal of the Syrian regime to respond to the Arab Spring demands of its youth (for dignity, better governance and jobs) to expand its control over ten million people in Iraq and Syria — bulldozing the border between the two countries.

      The Iraq war changed the regional balance of power in Iran’s favour, exacerbating a geopolitical struggle between it and Saudi Arabia. Across the wider region, the two powers gave their support to sectarian extremists, turning local grievances over poor governance into sectarian civil wars in which hundreds of thousands of Muslims were killed.

      In Syria, a total disdain was shown for international norms and the very notion of an international community was allowed to die. While all sides committed atrocities, the regime — aided by Iran and Russia — was by far the worst offender. More than half a million Syrians were killed, and over half the population displaced from their homes. No agreement could be reached in the UN Security Council on how to stop the bloodshed.

      Hundreds of thousands of people fled the region, crossing the Mediterranean Sea on flimsy boats to seek refuge in Europe. ISIS conducted horrific terrorist attacks in European cities, seeking to provoke a backlash against Muslims to show that the West was at war with Islam.

      Western public confidence in globalisation as well as in political elites and experts was eroded by policy failures at home (including the 2007–08 financial crisis in which millions of ordinary people lost their homes while governments bailed out the bankers) and abroad (including the wars in the Middle East, the outflow of refugees and terrorism). Regaining control of borders to limit immigration was a key driver of BREXIT, the British decision to leave the European Union.

      Donald Trump’s hostility to trade alliances, international law and multilateralism — and his tirades against Muslims, immigrants and terrorists — propelled him to the White House.

      Democracy is no longer on the move. In fact, the number of liberal democracies has been declining since 2006. Externally-driven regime change did not lead to liberal democracy — not in Iraq, Afghanistan, nor Libya.

      Instead, authoritarianism is on the rise. Contrary to hopes and expectations, China has not integrated into the US-led order. Rather, China is offering an alternative model where wealth and power can be amassed by opening to the global economy — but without a corollary political opening. The jury is still out on whether a totalitarian regime can self-correct in the face of crises. But for now, the ‘China Model’ of authoritarian state-led capitalism is appealing to autocrats everywhere.

      Today, the primary US national security concern is no longer terrorism, but rather great power competition. The rivalry between the United States and China is ultimately over which country offers a better road to progress. Although America remains powerful both militarily and economically, its international reputation and legitimacy as the standard-bearer of democracy has been greatly tarnished by two decades of fighting without winning since 9/11, by its hypocritical human rights violations, and by its own political dysfunction. As a result, the world’s democracies are in a weaker position than they otherwise might have been to face the challenge posed by a rising China.
