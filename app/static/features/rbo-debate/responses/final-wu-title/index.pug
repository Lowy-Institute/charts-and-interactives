  This is an example issue item page with the content removed. The blocks
  relate to those defined in the layout that's extended â€“ in this case that's
  the issue template that we define here...

extend ../../partials/article

block append config
  - page.attributes = data.getOne("static/features/rbo-debate/data").responses[6]

block content
  :marked
    Still to come
