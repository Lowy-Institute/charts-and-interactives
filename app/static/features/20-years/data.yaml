metaTitle: Celebrating 20 Years - Lowy Institute
description: >
  The Lowy Institute was born of Sir Frank Lowy’s desire to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his
  arrival in Australia by giving something back to the country that had embraced him and his family.
  A keen student of international affairs, he wanted to deepen the Australian debate about the world
  and give Australia a greater voice in the world.
