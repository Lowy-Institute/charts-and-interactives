        The Lowy Institute was born of [Sir&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;Lowy](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/people/executive-directors/bio/frank-lowy)â€™s desire to commemorate the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his arrival in Australia by giving something back to the country that had embraced him and his family. 
        
        A keen student of international affairs, he wanted to deepen the Australian debate about the world and give Australia a greater voice in the world.
