        The Lowy Institute has become known around the world for its convening power. Each year our beautiful [headquarters](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/31-bligh-street-office) in the heart of Sydney hosts dozens of speeches, conferences, and roundtables where the most important issues of our time are debated. Institute audiences have heard from presidents and prime ministers; foreign and defence ministers; spies and soldiers; international envoys and global experts.
