          The Lowy Institute has created a suite of publications that are eagerly anticipated and parsed around the world: the [Lowy Institute Poll](https://poll.lowyinstitute.org), the most authoritative survey of Australian attitudes to the world; the [Global Diplomacy Index](https://globaldiplomacyindex.lowyinstitute.org), mapping the world’s most significant diplomatic networks; [the Lowy Institute Papers](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications?type=183), Australia’s only book-length monographs on international issues; and the [Asia Power Index](https://power.lowyinstitute.org), still the world’s most comprehensive effort to measure power in the world’s most consequential region.
