    region: [
      name: "Asia–Pacific."
      text: "Although Asia–Pacific countries fared well as a whole against the coronavirus, country performance across the region varied significantly between high performers and persistent strugglers. Many smaller players, including Taiwan and New Zealand, were among the most successful at halting the spread of the virus. Regional experience with previous epidemics, such as SARS and MERS, appears to have better prepared governments and societies to cope with the onset of COVID-19. Favourable geography — combined with early border closures and effective public health systems — also proved advantageous for countries such as Australia and New Zealand. But significant underperformers, such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines emerged too, struggling to contain COVID-19 throughout much of 2020 with few signs of improvement."
    ,
      name: "Americas."
      text: "For almost all countries of the Americas (North and South), COVID-19 was an unremitting struggle over the course of 2020. Consistent underperformers included some of the largest regional players — Brazil, Colombia, and the United States. Much smaller Uruguay stood out as a positive outlier in comparison. Although the rate of new infections appeared to stabilise towards the end of the year, the region as a whole continued to see the virus spread."
    ,
      name: "Europe."
      text: "Europe’s management of the pandemic varied substantially over time. The continent began as the single worst affected region globally, after a first wave of infections spread quickly between neighbouring countries. But much of Europe successfully turned the situation around — becoming the best regional performer for more than two months — as lockdowns took effect. Similarities in country trends were driven by high degrees of economic integration and lack of border closures across the continent. Despite the mid-year improvement, European countries’ management of the crisis slipped again towards the end of 2020 as a second wave took hold. Broadly, the worst affected countries in the region have been those in Western Europe with relatively internationally mobile and affluent populations, while many smaller Baltic countries and Mediterranean island states — such as Malta and Cyprus — were spared the worst of the crisis."
    ,
      name: "Middle East & Africa."
      text: "Many countries in the Middle East and Africa made considerable efforts to contain the pandemic and had the time to put in place preventative measures at their borders as COVID-19 spread globally. Of the two regional sub-groupings, Sub-Saharan nations including Rwanda, Senegal, and Ghana were among the top performing countries, while the situation in several Middle Eastern states — notably Iraq and Israel — deteriorated sharply and placed them among the lowest performing countries."

    politics: [
      name: "Authoritarian regimes."
      text: "Many countries with an authoritarian system of government found initial success in supressing the pandemic before ultimately losing any early advantage. It may have been easier for authoritarian governments to rapidly impose initial lockdowns and to mobilise resources, but for many it proved difficult to sustain these measures and ensure social adherence in the long term. Significant differences within this set of nations meant that the performance of authoritarian countries spanned a wide spectrum by the end of the examined period."
    ,
      name: "Hybrid regimes."
      text: "Hybrid regimes, which combine autocratic features with democratic ones, have performed worse on average than other systems of government during the pandemic. In some cases, this may reflect underlying state weaknesses in mobilising resources, despite the authoritarian-leaning inclinations of governments. Poorer performance under some hybrid regimes may also have been symptomatic of a broader lack of trust in government. Many, but not all, countries within this grouping followed a wide U-shape in their performance, where experiences with the coronavirus worsened markedly before improving slightly as time passed."
    ,
      name: "Democracies."
      text: "Most democracies were able to course-correct during the pandemic, improving from initially being the worst-performing group of the three broad political systems examined. But this ability to learn from experience was not always sustained, as seen in the group’s slackening overall performance over time, and evident in the second waves of infections in Europe. After successfully grappling with the severity of the crisis, many democratic governments subsequently lost their resolve for intrusive and economically crippling lockdown measures on their citizens. At the country level, the performance of democracies varied greatly throughout the year, reflecting a diversity in governing approaches, varying degrees of social consensus for dealing with the pandemic, and differing political circumstances within the group."

    size: [
      name: "Small Populations."
      text: "In terms of population, less appears to be more. Countries with fewer than 10 million inhabitants performed notably better against the coronavirus than those with mid-sized or large populations. Countries in this grouping could ring-fence their borders around smaller populations. In addition, governments may have found it easier to build consensus for, and ensure adherence to, health guidelines on the back of strong social contracts between the state and its citizens, leading to better COVID-19 responses."
    ,
      name: "Medium Populations."
      text: "Countries with populations between 10–100 million, such as Germany and France, on average performed close to the median in terms of their collective COVID-19 responses. Nevertheless, this cohort of 49 countries had the greatest diversity in experiences with the pandemic at the national level. Governments of mid-sized countries possess neither the advantages of small countries in controlling virus spread, nor the inherent difficulties of governing very large populations."
    ,
      name: "Large populations."
      text: "Most countries with populations of more than 100 million people descended relatively quickly into the throes of the virus, with few signs of overall improvement, even by the beginning of 2021. Central governments of more populous countries face the challenging task of mitigating the spread of the virus among a greater number of people separated by fewer hard borders. Additionally, the higher prevalence of COVID-19 in more populous states may be related to the increased likelihood of those countries having one or more ‘mega cities’ with populations over 10 million. Densely inhabited urban areas — often highly globalised, such as New York, Tokyo, and New Delhi — proved to be early incubators for the coronavirus."

    income: [
      name: "Developing Economies."
      text: "<p>Early in the crisis, many developing countries fared better than their richer counterparts. Fewer international flight connections and tightened border controls lowered their exposure to the coronavirus from overseas. In many cases, it also bought developing countries more time to observe how other states dealt with the critical first stages of the pandemic and to implement World Health Organization guidelines in response. Governments of poorer countries were aware that they had limited hospital capacity to respond to the virus once transmissions spread through the community.</p><p>However, this lead faded over time. Many developing countries were unable to afford drawn out and economically crippling lockdowns to suppress community transmission. But even in countries such as India where the pandemic accelerated dramatically, reported mortality rates from COVID-19 were often comparatively low. Even accounting for potentially less reliable data, there were likely other variables affecting these outcomes. One factor may be that many developing countries have younger populations, who may be less prone to the worst effects of the virus.</p>"

      name: "Advanced economies."
      text: "Better healthcare systems and the fiscal ability to sustain lockdowns were strong advantages in managing the pandemic. These assets were particularly important in the middle of the pandemic when the ability of governments to support or supplement citizens’ incomes during extensive lockdowns became crucial. Yet, these factors were not guarantees of success against COVID-19, as demonstrated by the poor performance of several major advanced economies, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Countervailing forces were also at play — advanced economies tend to have older populations, with a greater proportion of the population vulnerable to COVID-19, and many elderly citizens living in aged care facilities, which were particularly prone to virus outbreaks. The lead established by high-income countries narrowed significantly towards the end of 2020 prior to the unrolling of mass COVID-19 vaccination programs."
