    # Note on exclusions & inclusions
    
    Countries with fewer than 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were not included in this assessment as they did not face a substantial COVID-19 outbreak within their borders in the examined period. In addition, a number of countries with more than 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 could not be included due to a lack of available data for at least one of the six indicators used to construct the Index during the entirety of the examined period. In order to track performance across time, this Interactive uses daily data to produce fourteen-day rolling averages. In the case of China, for example, Our World in Data is unable to derive daily number of tests performed in the entire country based on the two occasions in which testing data has been reported by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China to date. A detailed description of this can be found under the [source information](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing) of the Our World in Data series.
    
    An effort has been made to include countries where daily data for all six indicators is available for part of, but not the entirety of, the examined period. However, countries were not awarded a composite score in periods during which data was unavailable for any given indicator, resulting in a truncated assessment of their overall management of the pandemic over time. While data for the vast majority of countries was available for much of the 43-week period examined, there are 14 countries for which data is missing or incomplete for more than a third of the period under examination. These are: Armenia, Belarus, Brazil, Czech Republic, Jordan, Madagascar, Malawi, Oman, Palestinian Territories, South Sudan, Sweden, Tunisia and Vietnam. In the case of Sweden, for example, data on daily tests in aggregate and per capita terms was unavailable until 18 weeks after the country’s hundredth confirmed case of COVID-19. As a result, these countries have not been included in the country rankings, but can still be found in the country comparisons.
