        To gauge the relative performance of countries at different points in the pandemic, this Interactive tracked six measures of COVID-19 in the 116 countries for which data was available. The period examined spans the 43 weeks that followed every countryâ€™s hundredth confirmed case of COVID-19, using data available to 13 March 2021. Fourteen-day rolling averages of new daily figures were calculated for the following indicators:
         
        - Confirmed cases
        - Confirmed deaths 
        - Confirmed cases per million people
        - Confirmed deaths per million people 
        - Confirmed cases as a proportion of tests
        - Tests per thousand people

        An equally weighted average of the rankings across those indicators was then calculated for individual countries in each period and normalised to produce a score from 0 (worst performing) to 100 (best performing). Collectively, these indicators point to how well or poorly countries have managed the pandemic in the 43 weeks that followed their hundredth confirmed case of COVID-19.
         
        Further information on methodology, choice of indicators, and individual country scores and rankings can be found at the end of the Interactive.
