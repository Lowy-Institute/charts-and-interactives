  Figure 8: China’s lending pattern follows others but not by enough

notes: >
  Notes: 1. For Fiji, Palau, and Nauru, the IMF uses a ratings system for
  higher-income countries where it simply rates their debt outlook as
  “sustainable” rather than “unsustainable”. 2. Debt-to-GDP ratios are calculated
  as the simple average of debt ratios for individual Pacific countries in each
  grouping.
