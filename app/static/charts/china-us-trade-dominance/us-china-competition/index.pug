      Who dominates global trade? It is well recognised that China has become
      the world’s largest trading nation. Less appreciated is the effect this
      has had in displacing the United States from its traditional dominance as
      a trading partner for other countries around the world.

      We examined this using data from the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics
      [database](https://data.imf.org/?sk=9D6028D4-F14A-464C-A2F2-59B2CD424B85),
      which provides a repository of bilateral trade flows for most countries.
      We focus on gross trade flows (i.e. exports plus imports) which serves as
      a measure of the degree of trade integration between two economies and
      ask for each country whether the US or China is the larger trading
      partner.

      China’s rise since the turn of the century has been swift.

      In 2001, the year China acceded to the World Trade Organisation, over 80%
      of countries with data available had a larger volume of trade with
      America than China. By 2018, that figure was down to a little over 30% –
      with two-thirds of countries (128 out of 190) trading more with China
      than the United States.

      Equally important, 90 countries (almost half) traded more than twice as
      much with China as with America (these are shown in dark red in the
      chart).

      Driving this picture is that China’s economy is far more export driven
      than the US, it is deeply enmeshed in global supply chains, and has been
      growing much faster.

      In terms of policy drivers, many factors have been at play. But China’s
      2001 accession to the World Trade Organisation has clearly been central,
      with the number of countries trading more with China than with the United
      States increasing rapidly thereafter. This was aided by an under-valued
      exchange rate during this period that helped make Chinese exports
      especially competitive.

      The turning point for global trade was the 2008-09 financial crisis, with
      China overtaking the United States as the larger trading partner for more
      than half of all countries. In recent years the trend in China’s favour
      has petered out as its economy has slowed while America’s has picked up.
      China’s exchange is also no longer under-valued by most accounts.

      Regardless, the global trade landscape has already been substantially
      reshaped.
