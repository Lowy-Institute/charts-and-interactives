    <p>The effective conduct of international relations requires analytical and problem-solving ability as well as operational skills. It needs careful and thoughtful long-term planning to shape the best outcomes for the national interest but also needs swift reactions to often unforeseen international incidents. None of these tasks are best served by group-think and unacknowledged bias.<a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title="">[190]</a>&nbsp;On the balance of available evidence, gender diversity in its senior ranks gives an organisation a clear competitive advantage: it is better for the bottom line and leads to a more functional, cooperative and effective work environment.</p>
    <p>But despite the evidence, women remain a rarity across the very senior ranks of Australia’s IR sector and are yet to step into many of the sector’s most influential roles. Despite some notable trailblazers, imbalances remain, especially in high level leadership roles, and progress towards equality has been slow. The agencies and departments in the sector continue to lag APS averages, are behind the wider Australian workforce, and behind our Five-Eyes partners on many measures.</p>
    <p>Females are not rising to the highest ranks in the IR system at the same rate as men. They are not receiving overseas postings at the same rate or in the same locations, and are commonly found in corporate, people or ‘soft’ policy roles. The problem is particularly acute in the intelligence community - females are most underrepresented in agencies requiring the highest levels of security clearance. Additionally, many organisations in the sector have well-documented cultural problems and the sector as a whole appears to shelter behind assurances of meritocracy, while acknowledged and unacknowledged sources of bias persist. Women are also less visible in the media and in academia, where they are less frequently published, interviewed, quoted as sources, and cited than men.</p>
    <p>The IR sector is therefore letting itself and the country down. It does not represent the best value for taxpayers of the sector’s annual multi-billion dollar expenditure. It is not representative of Australian society, and its gender imbalance skews strategic decisions and policy responses. Having a senior cohort which is mostly male depicts a society which, despite its pretentions, has failed to progress socially; this is detrimental to the national interest and hinders the achievement of our foreign policy objectives. Finally, the sector is failing to take advantage of the best available talent to ensure the sector has the necessary capabilities to navigate Australia’s place in an increasingly complex world<em>.</em></p>
    <p>The data suggests that some progress has been made, with most organisations in the sector attempting actively to address this issue. Defence has made a strong, sustained and transparent effort to transform its culture and attract more women; AFP has also commissioned and published a comprehensive study of its culture and formulated a gender strategy for its international operations.<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" title="">[191]</a> Many of the agencies in the sector, however, have been far more timid in their approaches or have lost momentum when leadership engaged in these issues have moved on. There is still a long way to go across the sector as a whole and the following offer some preliminary recommendations to accelerate the process.</p>
    <h3>Build and support a career ladder for females (especially in the intelligence community)</h3>

        <h4 style="margin: 12px 0 0">Build and support a career ladder for females (especially in the intelligence community)</h4></div>
    </div>
    <p>The Australian Government should undertake an independent review looking at women and the Australian intelligence community. The terms of reference should include a commitment to deliver a public version of the review.</p>
    <p>All organisations should make systematic efforts to ensure their recruitment programs attract a diverse pool of high quality candidates and should be reviewing recruitment methods and outreach when this is not occurring. Recruitment rounds should broaden their criteria in order to reach a larger and more diverse pool of candidates. In particular, female students in STEM studies at tertiary institutions should be targeted for AIC recruitment. Organisations must be more energetic and social media-savvy with recruitment.</p>
    <p>Similarly, promotion rounds should be based on broader criteria and management should consider new techniques to filter out the impact of gender when considering candidates for promotion. Unconscious bias in promotion, hiring decisions and secondments must be studied, understood and addressed.</p>
    <p>There is scope for more and better mentoring programs to bolster women’s performance in promotion rounds, assisting them in preparing applications and interview techniques. Several of the IR organisations have policies for this already; the ongoing task is to ensure the most effective implementation.<a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" title="">[192]</a></p>
    <p>One option to address the severe imbalance in the AIC is for the soon-to-be-established Office of National Intelligence to create a dedicated branch to advance the AIC’s gender and diversity efforts. The branch should be staffed from across the intelligence community so that each agency’s unique traits and needs are represented and taken into consideration. This branch should be responsible for ensuring recommendations from the independent review of the sector are promptly and properly implemented.</p>
    <h3>Reduce barriers to women gaining overseas postings and assignments</h3>
    <div class="display-up-900 pub-content__feature pub-content__feature--fluid-right" style="width: 220px; margin-top: 8px;">
      <div class="pub-content__feature__content">
        <h6 class="text-uppercase" style="margin: 0"><span class="text-muted">Recommendation</span></h6>
        <h4 style="margin: 12px 0 0">Reduce barriers to women gaining overseas postings and assignments</h4></div>
    </div>
    <p>Departments and agencies with staff overseas should review best practice from other sectors in supporting staff working overseas and undertaking regular travel.<a href="#_ftn193" name="_ftnref193" title="">[193]</a> In 2017, the government cut household assistance costs for public servants overseas which had been used in part to cover childcare.<a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" title="">[194]</a> This created a double standard: In Australia, staff have access to the government childcare subsidy regime here, but on posting, there is no equivalent.&nbsp; IR departments and agencies should allow overseas officials with children, both male and female, access to a dedicated childcare allowance or rebate.</p>
    <p>Unconscious bias in the selection process for overseas postings needs to be understood and addressed, to ensure females are not unfairly passed over for these roles.</p>
    <p>Finally, political appointees to ambassadorial roles overseas should, at a minimum, reflect the gender diversity of parliament.<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195" title="">[195]</a></p>
    <h3>Genuine access to leave and flexible working arrangements</h3>
    <div class="display-up-900 pub-content__feature pub-content__feature--fluid-right" style="width: 220px; margin-top: 8px;">
      <div class="pub-content__feature__content">
        <h6 class="text-uppercase" style="margin: 0"><span class="text-muted">Recommendation</span></h6>
        <h4 style="margin: 12px 0 0">Genuine access to leave and flexible working arrangements</h4></div>
    </div>
    <p>Departments and agencies should prioritise flexible work arrangements and have these modelled by male and female senior executives. There are already public sector policies in place to accelerate progress on this, and agencies across the sector have incorporated them into their own gender strategies.<a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196" title="">[196]</a> However, progress has been slow. Men and women should have equal access to parental leave and flexibility, and more men should be encouraged to take this up. Parental leave entitlements for men should be expanded and promoted. Keep-in-touch policies for parents and those on carers leave should be reviewed and improved based on feedback from those that use them.</p>
    <h3>Tackle entrenched workplace cultures</h3>
    <div class="display-up-900 pub-content__feature pub-content__feature--fluid-right" style="width: 220px; margin-top: 8px;">
      <div class="pub-content__feature__content">
        <h6 class="text-uppercase" style="margin: 0"><span class="text-muted">Recommendation</span></h6>
        <h4 style="margin: 12px 0 0">Tackle entrenched workplace cultures</h4></div>
    </div>
    <p>Departments, agencies and organisations should audit organisational cultures to better understand internal issues and design appropriate policies and strategies. Several agencies within the sector have already conducted very useful cultural audits, such as Defence and AFP.<a href="#_ftn197" name="_ftnref197" title="">[197]</a> Other agencies should follow suit and conduct and publish such cultural audits. Without a better understanding of the entrenched cultural issues affecting an organisation, policies designed to address diversity are unlikely to be effective in their implementation.</p>
    <p>Organisations should also provide compulsory unconscious bias training and make in-confidence reporting mechanisms mandatory, so all staff can safely report discrimination, bullying and harassment without fear of retribution or career damage. Finally, while many agencies have ‘zero tolerance’ policies for sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination, these need to be enforced, and barriers to reporting addressed.</p>
    <h3>Increase transparency</h3>
    <div class="display-up-900 pub-content__feature pub-content__feature--fluid-right" style="width: 220px; margin-top: 8px;">
      <div class="pub-content__feature__content">
        <h6 class="text-uppercase" style="margin: 0"><span class="text-muted">Recommendation</span></h6>
        <h4 style="margin: 12px 0 0">Increase transparency</h4></div>
    </div>
    <p>Transparency is an issue across the sector. How organisations perform on gender balance should be a matter of the public record, which should in turn lead to greater accountability. The Defence ‘Women in the ADF Report’ is a good example, with highly detailed information enabling better analysis of bottlenecks and blockages. We recommend a similar level of transparency for all agencies and organisations in the sector, broken down by gender at all staffing levels, and the compulsory public availability of all taxpayer-funded gender and diversity strategies and independent reviews. Where security concerns exist, such as in the intelligence sector, sanitised versions should be made available to the public, as several of our Five-Eyes partners have done.<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198" title="">[198]</a></p>
    <h3>Enforce achievable, visible changes such as event, panel and board parity </h3>
    <div class="display-up-900 pub-content__feature pub-content__feature--fluid-right" style="width: 220px; margin-top: 8px;">
      <div class="pub-content__feature__content">
        <h6 class="text-uppercase" style="margin: 0"><span class="text-muted">Recommendation</span></h6>
        <h4 style="margin: 12px 0 0">Enforce achievable, visible changes such as event, panel and board parity </h4></div>
    </div>
    <p>Board Members, Vice-Chancellors, Ministers, APS Secretaries and think-tank Directors should introduce public-facing gender-equality policies into their organisations. Examples are panel composition, event participation and board composition. The Australian government should introduce an APS-wide panel pledge that extends to conferences held abroad. All organisations in the sector should adopt the 40:40:20<a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199" title="">[199]</a> approach to boards and committees. Organisations should adopt pro-active measures to celebrate the accomplishments of both male and female staff members, as DFAT did when it named meeting rooms after women for the first time in 2016.<a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200" title="">[200]</a></p>
    <h3>Hold organisations and management accountable</h3>
    <div class="display-up-900 pub-content__feature pub-content__feature--fluid-right" style="width: 220px; margin-top: 8px;">
      <div class="pub-content__feature__content">
        <h6 class="text-uppercase" style="margin: 0"><span class="text-muted">Recommendation</span></h6>
        <h4 style="margin: 12px 0 0">Hold organisations and management accountable</h4></div>
    </div>
    <p>The <em>Balancing the Future: Australian Public Service Gender Equality Strategy 2016-2019 </em>states that the government is working ‘towards an overarching goal of achieving 50-50 gender balance,’ and that individual departments and agencies should have their own strategies for achieving this. In accordance with this, all departments and agencies examined in this report have some variation of gender equality or diversity action plan, with their own targets and timeframes.<a href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201" title="">[201]</a> However a lack of accessible, current, sex-disaggregated data for all agencies makes it difficult for the public to assess performance against these targets or to hold organisations accountable. Strategies and policies that are place must be monitored and evaluated to ensure they are actually being followed and are effective.</p>
    <p>Leaders and organisations must be held equally accountable. All individual agency and department’s diversity targets should be attached to management performance assessments in meaningful ways, including at the Secretary and Director-General level with Minister-level involvement for any who fall short. &nbsp;</p>
