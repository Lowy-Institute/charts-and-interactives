    <p>Australia’s international relations sector<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> has a gender problem. Whether the focus is Australia’s diplomatic envoys, government departments with international functions, academia or think tanks, or the Australian Parliament, there is an acute shortage of senior women serving in the most important and strategic roles either in Australia or abroad.</p>
    <p>There has never been a female ambassador to London, Washington DC, Jakarta, Tokyo, Bangkok or Seoul<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and only 34.5 per cent of Australian ambassadors, high commissioners and heads of mission are women. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Three of twelve members (and two of the eleven Secretaries) sitting on the influential Secretaries Committee on National Security are women, an increase from none in 2015-16 and the highest in the committee’s history.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> The gender imbalance of Parliament’s Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security over the past 25 years has also been acute. The Committee has never been chaired by a female MP and has spent almost half its existence with no female members at all, including as recently as 2015. Female membership is currently 18 per cent.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Only four times in history – out of approximately 200 appointments – have women headed Australia’s internationally-focused public service departments and agencies.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> For the purposes of this study, these are the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Attorney General’s, Defence, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) / Department of Home Affairs <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>, Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C), plus Treasury, Australian Federal Police (AFP), Austrade<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> and Australia’s six intelligence agencies.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></p>
    <p>There are far fewer women in the senior management of these organisations when compared with the average across the Australian Public Service (APS).<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> Only 14 per cent of heads of the departments and agencies in the study are women (two in fourteen), <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> compared with 50 per cent of all government department heads<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> and (in 2016) 31 per cent of all APS agency heads . <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> Around 44 per cent of senior management across the public service are female<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a>, compared with just 33 per cent of the core internationally-facing departments and agencies in this study.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Women are chronically under-represented in Australia’s Intelligence Community (AIC), particularly at the senior levels<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a> and across technical, operational and analytical roles.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> Female presence in senior executive positions in the AIC is far below the Australian public service average and in some agencies this presence has even declined over the past five years, falling as low as 9 per cent in ONA in 2016 and 24 per cent across the Defence intelligence agencies.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> While there is limited data publicly available, from our soundings it appears female intelligence officials – across all the intelligence agencies – are gaining senior overseas roles at even lower rates than their female diplomatic counterparts.</p>
    <p>Perhaps most important of all, women rarely feature in the sector’s key policy-shaping activities. Based on research of declared authorship, a woman is yet to be selected to lead on any major foreign policy, defence, intelligence or trade white paper, inquiry or independent review. In fact, for author and advisory panel positions from 1972-2017 women have in total comprised only about 6.5 per cent of such positions.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a></p>
    <h3>Why gender diversity matters</h3>
    <p>Gender diversity matters for several reasons. Firstly, a more diverse workforce means the IR sector not only reflects Australia’s society as a whole, but equally importantly, broadens the population coverage of the sector and therefore boosts its talent pool. Secondly, gender-balanced workforces bring a greater range of ideas and experiences, lead to more innovation and better decision-making, and are a more positive and healthier workforce.</p>
    <p>Finally, a plethora of studies have shown that greater female participation is economically beneficial, both to the corporate sector’s profit levels but also to a country’s Gross Domestic Profit (GDP.) Translating this to the IR sector, a more ‘profitable’ (as well as cost-effective sector) means one which functions better and achieves better results.</p>
    <h4>Gender diverse teams better capture the available talent and provide a more capable workforce</h4>
    <p>An IR sector which reflects the whole of Australian society - half of which is female - draws from the broadest available talent pool. A diverse sector is more representative of the whole of society and therefore serves it more fairly. There is evidence that men and women approach legislative decision-making differently, and that, although tempered by women’s individual priorities, legislators tend to promote policy relevant to their gender’s needs. Women have been found to place a greater priority on domestic gender equality than men do and are more likely to view the full participation of women and girls in society as an important foreign policy goal.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> Female legislators promote greater provision of female health services,<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a> and are more likely to vote and advocate for women’s issues.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a></p>
    <p>Yet Australia does poorly even on the simple measure of women in parliament, who comprised 28.7 per cent of Australia’s lower house after the 2016 federal election.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a> As at November 2018, Australia is placed in 50th position among 193 nations - between Philippines and South Sudan - on the Inter-Parliamentary Union ranking of gender composition in world parliaments.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a> This position has barely moved in the last decade.</p>
    <p>The principle applies more broadly than just to legislative decision-making. The gender composition of policy-making and influential organisations may also affect their choice of issues to address and the priority they give those issues. A 2014 study of male and female economists in the United States found that men and women held widely different opinions on certain areas of economics, most notably on policy issues concerning gender, such as the wage gap and equal opportunity. <a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a> A similar study in Europe also found marked differences in opinion regarding equal opportunity and that females were more likely to favour increased environmental protection and government economic intervention.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a></p>
    <p>Lower levels of gender equality can also impede the effectiveness of decision-making. Societies with more equal levels of representation and high gender equality have been shown to be more stable<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a>, peaceful and secure.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a></p>
    <p>A more diverse workforce is a more capable workforce – a point that has been made by numerous senior officials across the Australian IR sector as well as in significant reports from other countries and other sectors.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a> Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, former Chief of the Defence Force, has argued that gender diversity is critical for defence capability: “The greater our diversity, the greater the range of ideas and insights to challenge the accepted norm, assess the risks, see them from a different perspective and develop creative solutions”.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a> Dennis Richardson, former Secretary of both Defence and DFAT and former head of ASIO, makes the point that gender balance is in an organisation’s “pragmatic self-interest in wanting to have the biggest gene pool possible”, a point also made in the 2015 Women in the UK Intelligence Community parliamentary report. According to Mr Richardson, a good gender mix also produces a healthier workforce and workplace: “mixed teams tend to work better”.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">[31]</a> A range of management studies support this, concluding that gender diversity in management provides a wider range of knowledge, ideas and abilities that are of benefit to organisations.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title="">[32]</a></p>
    <p>Diverse companies attract better talent, are more innovative, generate higher employee satisfaction, and are better decision-makers.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title="">[33]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In leadership and policy-making, the evidence suggests that women build coalitions and consensus more quickly than men. A 2015 analysis &nbsp;of 156 peace agreements by the Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding found that when women were included in negotiations, a peace agreement was more likely to be reached and implemented, and the probability those agreements would last more than 15 years increased by 35 per cent.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">[34]</a> A review into the treatment of women in the Australian Defence Force found that diversity in leadership was crucial to capacity and led to more effective problem solving.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="">[35]</a> A correlation has also been found between women in political office and a nation’s economic competitiveness.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">[36]</a></p>
    <h4>Gender diversity improves performance</h4>
    <p>Gender balanced teams make economic sense. Organisations with a good gender balance perform better financially.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">[37]</a> A 2016 study of 21,980 organisations in 91 countries by the Peterson Institute for International economics concluded that “the presence of women in corporate leadership positions may improve firm performance and that <strong>the magnitudes of the correlations are not small.</strong>”<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title="">[38]</a></p>
    <p>Organisations with greater gender diversity have more revenue, customers, market share and profits.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="">[39]</a> Evidence from McKinsey, Credit Suisse and Peterson Institute shows the higher proportion of women in senior management, the greater the return to shareholders.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title="">[40]</a> Organisations which are the least diverse, by comparison, don’t merely not lead, they actually lag.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="">[41]</a></p>
    <p>The evidence also cautions against putting too much emphasis on the so-called ‘trailblazers’: in fact, having more women across senior leadership appears to have a bigger impact than having a woman on the board or as the CEO. The correlation between more female executives and higher profits “<strong>underscores the importance of creating a pipeline of female managers and not simply getting lone women to the top</strong>.”<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="">[42]</a></p>
    <p>This economic argument can be extrapolated to countries, not just corporations. There is strong evidence that reducing the gender gap increases a nation’s gross domestic product.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[43]</a> The same argument applies to Australia. If an extra six per cent of women were added to the Australian workforce, GDP would increase by about one per cent, or $25 billion, according to Grattan Institute modelling.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[44]</a></p>
    <p>Since the IR sector is largely made up of taxpayer-funded organisations in the public service, universities, government think tanks and some NGOs, those taxpayer funds should be put to the best possible use. On the evidence available, improving the gender balance of organisations in this sector is likely to improve their efficiency, their value to the taxpayer as well as their overall performance.</p>
    <h4>Despite notable trailblazers, imbalances remain</h4>
    <p>Of course, there are so ‘trailblazers’ in this sector, particularly in the last few years. In Australia, at the end of 2018, we have a female Foreign Minister, Senator Marise Payne, Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister, Senator Penny Wong and Secretary of DFAT, Frances Adamson. From September 2015 to August 2018, the Defence Minister was a woman (Senator Payne). Over the last 30 years we have seen a female Prime Minister (Julia Gillard), Governor-General (Quentin Bryce), the country’s first female Foreign Minister (Julie Bishop), the country’s first female Secretaries of public service departments, and four women appointed into the exclusive ‘Group of Eight’ University Vice Chancellor roles.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[45]</a> Then there have been consecutive female Ambassadors to China, and Australia’s first female Defence intelligence agency director (in the role from 2012-15).<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title="">[46]</a> On these examples, it is tempting to conclude that the sector’s gender diversity challenges are largely resolved.</p>
    <p>Most of these women, however, were inaugural in their positions. Once a glass ceiling is shattered, the risk is that very little attention is paid to what happens next. In some cases, these women broke new ground in their respective professions that, many years later, has not been trodden since. Ironically, there is evidence that the achievements of these trailblazers can cause organisations to become complacent, rather than more proactive, about gender diversity.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title="">[47]</a> Looking more broadly, a small number of women reaching highly visible leadership roles has done little to address the systemic gender imbalances at executive and senior management levels. Their presence may, in fact, mask these issues, leading decision makers to conclude they no longer need to invest as heavily in finding solutions.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">[48]</a> Furthermore, a small handful of trailblazers does not represent the broad range of women’s experiences and views.</p>
    <p>Apart from these trailblazers, there has been some progress in righting gender imbalances over the last two decades, but the data on the IR gender balance indicates that the pace of change has been slow, and the progress uneven.</p>
    <p>Some government departments such as Attorney-General’s and PM&amp;C are outliers, with the proportion of women at the senior executive level now close to or passing 50 per cent<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title="">[49]</a>. For others, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs, numbers of women in senior ranks has doubled, but from a very low base. For example, 12 per cent of DFAT’s senior executive service (SES) were women in 1996. By the end of the 2017-2018 financial year, that number had risen to 36 per cent.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title="">[50]</a> Yet at DFAT’s junior executive level (EL1) – the single biggest group in the organisation – women have for years made up a majority of the cadre.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">[51]</a> Rather than outstripping other organisations such as Defence which are far more male-dominated, DFAT’s progress only matches that of the Defence Department APS, which had women in 33 per cent of its SES roles at the end of 2018<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title="">[52]</a>, up from 9 per cent two decades earlier.</p>
    <p>Progress has been even worse within the intelligence community. Two decades ago, 10 per cent of senior ONA executives were female. In June 2016, however, there were no women at all in ONA’s senior cadre.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title="">[53]</a> ONA has improved from this very low base in the last two years, adding 56 staff overall (40%) and five senior women, improving the proportion of women in the senior executive to 29% - still under one third. ASIO has done better, with 35% of its SES being female at the end of the 2016 financial year,<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title="">[54]</a> but for the three intelligence agencies within Defence the proportion of senior women is just under a quarter<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title="">[55]</a> and has declined slightly since 2006, a decade earlier.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title="">[56]</a></p>
    <h2>International and Australian comparisons</h2>
    <p>Of the 18 Commonwealth government departments, nine (50 per cent) are led by women<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="">[57]</a>. Women made up almost one-third (31 per cent) of public sector agency heads in 2016.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title="">[58]</a> But only 14 per cent (2 of 14)<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title="">[59]</a> of the internationally-focused agencies we have examined are led by women, a figure which was zero until 2016 when Frances Adamson was appointed secretary of DFAT.</p>
    <p>In these major leadership roles, the IR sector also trails the private sector, where women account for 17.1 per cent of all CEOs<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title="">[60]</a>, and 35 per cent of senior management personnel.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title="">[61]</a> The government’s peak national security committee – the Secretaries Committee on National Security established in 1996<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title="">[62]</a> which pulls together Canberra’s key international policy, security, defence and intelligence heads – has been an all-male committee for the majority of its 22-year history.<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title="">[63]</a> With three women on the committee now (DFAT Secretary Frances Adamson, Finance Secretary Rosemary Huxtable and the recently-appointed PM&amp;C Deputy Secretary National Security Caroline Millar) the committee’s current gender balance of 3 in 12, or 25 per cent female members, appears to be at its highest in the committee’s history.<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title="">[64]</a></p>
    <p>It is not only in the CEO positions that the IR sector is trailing its domestic government and corporate counterparts. All of the government departments and agencies in our sample, with the exception of the Attorney-General’s and PM&amp;C, fall below the 2016-17 APS average of 44 per cent women in their senior management.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title="">[65]</a> Some, particularly in the defence and intelligence agencies, fall considerably below that figure. Around a quarter of senior executive positions in the Defence intelligence agencies are held by women, 29 per cent at ONA (up from nine per cent as recently as 2016),<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title="">[66]</a> 36 per cent at DFAT<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title="">[67]</a> and 33 per cent at Defence (APS/civilian).<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title="">[68]</a> In the ADF, 12.2 per cent of the senior leadership were women in 2017.<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title="">[69]</a></p>

    <p>Just over a third (37 per cent) of DFAT’s senior executive service were women at the end of the 2017-2018 financial year, despite making up 58 per cent of DFAT’s total workforce<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title="">[70]</a>. While this was a significant improvement on the situation twenty years earlier when the number was 12 per cent<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title="">[71]</a>, it is lower than the share of women in the US State Department’s senior executive service (39.5 per cent), despite the State Department having less than half (43.6 per cent) women overall. <a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title="">[72]</a> In the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth office, the numbers and proportions are very similar.<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title="">[73]</a> New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade comprises 55 per cent women, and 43 per cent of its senior leadership are women.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title="">[74]</a></p>

    </div>
    <p>When it comes to putting females in senior roles overseas, Australia also lags badly. Australia’s female representation at Head of Mission level (ambassadors and high commissioners) is the second worst amongst our Five-Eyes partner countries at 34.5 per cent <a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title="">[75]</a> - better than the UK at 31 per cent<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title="">[76]</a>, and behind New Zealand (39 per cent)<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title="">[77]</a>, the United States (39 per cent)<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title="">[78]</a> and Canada, which at 45 per cent<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title="">[79]</a> is considerably more equal in its senior representation abroad.</p>
    <p>Australia’s gender underperformance in the IR sector does not reflect its gender record overall. In fact, Australia sits at second place among G20 nations in terms of the gender balance it has reached in senior public sector roles, ahead of both the United States and UK.<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title="">[80]</a> According to the government’s Workplace Gender Equality Agency, 17.1 per cent of non-public sector CEOs in Australia are women.<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title="">[81]</a> Although this number remains stubbornly low (up from 16.5 per cent the previous year), Australia outperforms many of its western counterparts on this measure including the US (8 per cent), the UK (6 per cent), France (2 per cent) and Germany (1 per cent).<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title="">[82]</a></p>
    <p>In the corporate sector as well, Australia performs better than key peers. The percentage of women on ASX 200 boards is currently 28.5 per cent<a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title="">[83]</a> - this is higher than for the UK equivalent (the FTSE 250, with 23 per cent women directors in 2017)<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title="">[84]</a> and also better than the US, with 20 per cent female board seats at S&amp;P 500 companies in 2017.<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title="">[85]</a> Canada also lags Australia on this score, with women in 22.6 per cent of FP500 board seats.<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title="">[86]</a></p>
    <h3>Senior women missing in action across the sector</h3>
    <p>It has been more than fifty years since the Commonwealth ‘marriage bar’ was lifted in 1966, six years before the US State Department and seven years before the UK Foreign Service lifted theirs.<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title="">[87]</a> Since then, the Australian Government has produced approximately thirty major white papers, reviews and inquiries that have shaped Australia’s international relations architecture and influenced its foreign policy. There have been more than a dozen associated with defence, eight for foreign affairs and aid and at least five on eight for foreign affairs and aid and at least five on economy and trade. In fifty-one years, not one of these major policy-setting exercises has been led by a woman.</p>
    <p>This unadorned statistic suggests that women are neither seen nor respected as strategists or strategic leaders. Women do appear occasionally on the ‘advisory panels’ associated with these documents. For example, women comprised 12.5 per cent of advisers to the 1997 foreign affairs white paper panel<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title="">[88]</a>, 25 per cent of the external reference group for the 2011 strategic review of the Treasury<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title="">[89]</a> and 20 per cent of the review panel for the 2014 independent review of aid effectiveness.<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title="">[90]</a> But thus far, the primary authors, reviewers and advisers on Australian defence and intelligence reviews - including the 2016 Defence White Paper<a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" title="">[91]</a>, the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper and the most recent 2017 independent intelligence review<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92" title="">[92]</a> - have all been male.</p>
    <p>Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet (PM&amp;C), Treasury and the AGD have only ever been led by men since their establishment, despite women often having held the Deputy Secretary positions in each of those departments. In PM&amp;C’s international and security-related divisions, only two women have formally served directly under the Secretary: the current Deputy Secretary National Security Caroline Millar, appointed in late 2018, and former senior defence official Margot McCarthy, who was in the role – then-styled National Security Adviser - from 2012 to 2015. . <a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title="">[93]</a></p>
    <p>Defence, and particularly the armed forces which make up the Australian Defence Force, is a special case. The ‘pipeline’ of women available to draw on for promotions is far smaller than for other organisations in the sector. Female participation in the ADF has historically been very low, and is currently at 17.9 per cent in 2017-18, with Army having the lowest proportion of women at 14.3 per cent of the force.<a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title="">[94]</a></p>
    <p>From 2012, Defence has made concerted efforts to identify and address the drivers of this low female participation, and initiated a process to generate a comprehensive set of strategies to improve women’s experiences and career progress in the Australian Defence Force. The ‘Pathway to Change’ process resulted from a series of reviews into Defence and ADF culture, following a series of incidents of abuse and harassment within Defence.<a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95" title="">[95]</a> Among those reviews was the independent review of the treatment of women in the Defence force (the ‘Broderick Report’)<a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" title="">[96]</a> and the Carmel McGregor review on employment pathways for APS women in Defence.<a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title="">[97]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the challenges outlined in these reports, Defence leadership has progressively implemented the Pathways to Change agenda, including initiatives to lift female participation in its workforce and improve their progress through its ranks. Restrictions on women serving in combat roles were lifted in 2013.<a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98" title="">[98]</a> Ambitious long-term participation targets have been set: for Army, 15 per cent women by 2023; for Navy and Air Force, 25 per cent by 2023.<a href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99" title="">[99]</a> To improve transparency and aid efforts for a more diverse organisation, an annual report on women in the ADF was established.<a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" title="">[100]</a> A diversity council and diversity champion were appointed, recruitment efforts broadened, unconscious bias training programs implemented, as well as a number of other important initiatives including improved flexible work practices.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But despite these reforms, the pace of change is slow, and the composition of the organisation’s leadership remains at issue. In 2006, only 15 of 468 leaders (3 per cent of those ranked Colonel and above) were women. In 2016, that number was 72 of 617 leaders, or 11.7 per cent – an improvement, but from a tiny base. <a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101" title="">[101]</a> In the Defence APS, which makes up 22 per cent of its total workforce<a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" title="">[102]</a>, women would be expected to fare better, and they do. Women represent 42 per cent of all Defence APS staff, and 33 per cent of its senior staff<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" title="">[103]</a>. However, the last Defence Secretary, Dennis Richardson, observed that former ADF (male) employees moving to civilian roles distorts the gender balance at the executive levels. According to Mr Richardson, around 20 per cent of Defence APS is drawn from the ADF. Their training and experience prepares them better for promotion rounds, adding an additional layer of competition for the non-ADF women in the corps.<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" title="">[104]</a></p>
    <p>The Defence Department points to its work in addressing the gender imbalance in promotion and selection rounds. Broadening the selection and promotion criteria in the past few years as part of the Pathways process has delivered a more balanced result.<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" title="">[105]</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Defence has also made some progress in elevating senior women. Rebecca Skinner, formerly head of Defence People, was appointed in late 2016 to the Deputy Secretary, Strategic Policy and Intelligence role. She held the role for just a year before moving to acting associate secretary, a role which includes oversight of the security and vetting service, and fills in for the Secretary when required.<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106" title="">[106]</a> Justine Greig is the Deputy Secretary Defence People<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107" title="">[107]</a>, replacing another senior female executive, Roxanne Kelley, who has moved to a more senior role in the Department of Social Services.<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108" title="">[108]</a> According to the Department, recent shifts in senior ranks have enabled access for a small pool of women at the lower SES levels in particular, but ‘it should not be overstated, however … five years [ago] this could not have been said’.<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" title="">[109]</a></p>
    <h3>A gendered international footprint </h3>
    <p>A woman has never been appointed as head of five of Australia’s ten largest overseas posts: the United States, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand. Only three of those ten largest missions are currently headed by a woman, and over the entire history of those ten missions, females have filled the head of mission role only four per cent of the time. Most of the remaining large posts have only seen one female Ambassador in their history, with the notable exception of China which has seen two consecutive female Ambassadors.<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110" title="">[110]</a> In 2018, only 31 per cent of Australia’s ambassadors serving overseas at the two most senior levels<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111" title="">[111]</a> –&nbsp; positions that tend to run our largest and most important posts overseas – are female. Of Australia’s top ten two-way trading partners, only three currently have a female head of mission, and five have never had a female head of mission.<a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" title="">[112]</a></p>

      <iframe frameborder="0" width="900" height="360" scrolling="no" src="https://lowy-charts.netlify.com/charts/gender-diversity-and-australias-international-relations/australian-heads-of-mission/" style="display: block; margin: auto" width="100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>Compounding the problem is the track record in government appointments of politicians to senior diplomatic roles.<a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113" title="">[113]</a> Of Australia’s 15 former heads of mission in the United States and the United Kingdom, 26 per cent and 46 per cent respectively have been male political appointees.<a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" title="">[114]</a> The Australian Government has never appointed a female politician to these prestigious (and attractive) postings.</p>
    <p>There has been some progress in the last decade and this should not be discounted<a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115" title="">[115]</a>. For the first time ever, for example, women have been appointed to the top positions in China (twice), India, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines – four very important bilateral relationships. Historically, though, the data shows a clear trend: Australia’s largest and most strategically or economically important posts are more likely to be headed by men. By comparison, the posts where a female Ambassador is most likely to be found include Cambodia (seven female Ambassadors), Croatia (five), Mauritius (four), Lebanon (four), Spain (four) and New Caledonia (four).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For a modern and progressive nation, this sort of imbalance presents a negative picture of Australia. Sending mostly men to the most important global positions and fora and to deal with complex intelligence and analytical issues is inimical to Australia’s national interest and to the effective pursuit of Australia’s foreign policy interests. A significant proportion of Australia’s policy work abroad focuses on the importance of economic development, democracy, peace-building, and good governance. None of these messages is enhanced by being delivered mostly by middle-aged men.</p>
    <p>The trend is not confined to diplomats and foreign affairs. DFAT is only one of at least 23 government departments and agencies that posts its Australian officials overseas.<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title="">[116]</a> While little public data is available for the intelligence community, we understand that across many of the agencies, a range of key liaison relationships overseas have yet to be managed by women.</p>
    <p>Of the two overseas postings for the Office of National Assessments for example - in London and Washington DC - the London position has been filled five times but only once by a woman. No woman has ever held the agency’s more senior position in Washington. The three defence intelligence agencies have a patchy record on female appointments. The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has posted a small number of women to its most senior positions in Washington and London.<a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" title="">[117]</a> The Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO) has also intermittently had a female heading up its US liaison office in 6 of the past 15 years.<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" title="">[118]</a> Other agencies, including the Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO), have never had women manage their key liaison relationships in Washington and London.<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" title="">[119]</a></p>
    <p>The Defence department faces a particular set of challenges, with a very small proportion of women overall. Defence has implemented a series of policies and targets for improving its gender composition, as described above. However, the numbers are still pitifully small. Only twice between 1996 and 2016 was a woman sent as Defence attaché to one of Defence’s top ten postings abroad: Wellington in New Zealand, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, both in the last six years. <a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120" title="">[120]</a> In 2006, 10 per cent of staff at Defence overseas positions were women. Ten years later, the number had barely shifted, to just 11 per cent. <a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" title="">[121]</a></p>

    Across other departments and agencies in the sample, the story is the same. departments which have high proportions both of women overall and women in senior roles, such as Attorney-General’s, Austrade and Treasury, the numbers of women posted abroad are disproportionately small. In AGD, for example, women made up 67 per cent <a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122" title="">[122]</a> of all employees and 47 per cent of its senior cadre<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" title="">[123]</a> but only 33 per cent its staff posted abroad in 2016.<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" title="">[124]</a> At Austrade, 54 per cent<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" title="">[125]</a> of the organisation were women in early 2017 but overseas that figure drops to 35 per cent,<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" title="">[126]</a> and at Treasury although 53 per cent of the organisation and 33 per cent of its SES are female<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127" title="">[127]</a>, overseas that figure drops to 11 per cent.<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" title="">[128]</a>
    <p>In the online survey ‘Gender Diversity and Australia’s International Relations’<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129" title="">[129]</a>, conducted as part of our research, 68 per cent of respondents agreed that the selection process for overseas opportunities is affected by conscious or unconscious bias. Further, 65 per cent of respondents identified a lack of transparency surrounding some overseas work opportunities. These perceptions are corroborated in interviews with several agency and departmental senior staff conducted for our research. An interview with a senior executive at Austrade<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" title="">[130]</a> uncovered some difficulties for women with families in undertaking overseas postings, many of which are in emerging economies. Another interviewee offered that men with families are much more likely to get important overseas roles than women with families, that gender norms and stereotypes often play a role in hiring and that some women who move into these senior overseas postings have made deliberate decisions not to have children.<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" title="">[131]</a></p>
    <h3>An intelligence glass ceiling </h3>
    <p>Australia’s intelligence agencies have a poor record when it comes to women in leadership, and the issue is aggravated by a lack of transparency in reporting even basic gender statistics. Scant data is publicly available.<a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" title="">[132]</a> But data gathered for this research project, with the cooperation of the agencies, indicates that the proportion of women in the senior executive service across all of these agencies falls below, and in some cases very far below, the APS average of 44 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Australian intelligence community has both a pipeline and a ladder problem. The pipeline problem is that women are joining the community at far lower rates than male recruits. Across the four<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" title="">[133]</a> agencies for which we have been able to obtain data, 38 per cent of junior (non-senior executive) staff are female, and this number masks an even lower proportion of female operational/analytical recruits because it is skewed by the high number of females in corporate roles.</p>
    <p>For some agencies, the pipeline problem starts even earlier than the recruitment stage. For example, many roles in the intelligence community such as cyber security and data analysis call for engineering or other STEM (science, technical, engineering and mathematics) backgrounds. Many parts of Defence, including the defence intelligence agencies, also call for capability in engineering, technical and construction roles, and the demand for such skills is growing.<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title="">[134]</a> Yet the proportion of women in STEM disciplines is very low across society.<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" title="">[135]</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The ladder problem reflects the phenomenon occurring across the whole sector, in that female career intelligence officers are not ascending to senior ranks at the same rate as their male counterparts. While 29 per cent of Executive Levels 1 and 2 are women across the agencies, 86 per cent of those on SES level 2 in 2016 were men.<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" title="">[136]</a></p>
    <p>In 2016, only 33 per cent and 29 per cent of ASD and AGO’s total staff were women.<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" title="">[137]</a> Even fewer women are in their pipelines: for both agencies women comprised only 24 per cent of the security clearances requested in 2015-16.<a href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138" title="">[138]</a> The third defence intelligence agency, DIO, carries a better gender balance overall at 43 per cent<a href="#_ftn139" name="_ftnref139" title="">[139]</a> women. DIO is less technically-focused than the other Defence intelligence agencies, which may explain its better gender result. However, the most recent Parliamentary review of AIC administration and expenditure noted that women continued to be ‘underrepresented at DIO’s senior levels.’<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140" title="">[140]</a></p>
    <p>In addition, women are missing from the community’s high-level agenda-setting activities. Similar to the position in defence and foreign affairs, a woman has never led or co-authored any of Australia’s intelligence reviews or inquiries. Furthermore, of the official interviews conducted with individuals by the 2017 independent intelligence review authors, only 16 per cent (12/75) of them were with women.<a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141" title="">[141]</a></p>
    <p>Australia’s first and only female intelligence director was appointed in 2012 to the Australian Geospatial Organisation (AGO), one of the smallest agencies in the AIC, and held the position until 2015.<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" title="">[142]</a> The other five agencies have yet to be led by a female Director-General. According to our research, some current female Deputy Directors-General are the first women to serve in the position, while other agencies have never appointed a female Deputy Director-General. Currently in some agencies, women don’t appear in the organisational chart until the third tier down. Of those agencies that have featured senior women on their books, several were not career intelligence officers but secondees from outside the AIC.</p>
    <p>Of the women who do succeed in breaking into AIC senior management, the authors were repeatedly told they are found regularly filling corporate functions and less likely to hold core operational, analytical and technical roles.<a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" title="">[143]</a></p>
    <p>The intelligence agencies of the AIC appear to be committed to addressing the gender imbalances in their ranks. ONA publicly released a 2015-18 Diversity Action plan which included measurable commitments and review timeframes.<a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" title="">[144]</a> Its performance against that plan has been strong in its past two years of growth mode following the 2017 Intelligence Review, and the number of female senior executives has lifted from zero (of ten) in 2016 to five (of seventeen) in 2018. Similarly, ASIO put a Gender Equity Strategy in place in 2016 and announced a series of ‘Gender Equity Bold Goals’ in that same year, outlining two key goals and commitments.<a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" title="">[145]</a> The Defence Department has also conducted annual gender reviews and has implemented a set of strategies to improve the position of women across the organisation (including in its intelligence agencies).<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146" title="">[146]</a></p>
    <p>Despite these strategies, however, of the 233 respondents in our Lowy Institute survey who expressed a view on how committed intelligence agencies are to ‘achieving real progress on gender equality’, 51 per cent answered that intelligence agencies were ‘not committed’, 42 per cent said they were somewhat committed and only 6 per cent said they were ‘very committed’. &nbsp;Of the 357 who gave their views on the commitment of the ‘Defence Force and Policing’ to the same question, 31 per cent answered that these agencies were ‘not committed,’ 59 per cent said they were ‘somewhat committed,’ and only 11 per cent said they were ‘very committed.’</p>
    <p>The Parliamentary Committee for Intelligence and Security is the natural body to review and probe the AIC’s progress on gender equality. But the committee itself has had few female members, has never had a female chair and as recently as 2014/15 it was a 13-member all male committee. This positions the committee badly to hold the AIC accountable for its poor gender record.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>The issue of security clearances</h3>
    <p>One of the themes emerging from interviews for this study was the issue of security clearances, and a suspicion that the process of gaining security clearances for roles in parts of the sector was biased against female applicants. This suspicion is exacerbated by the data which shows that organisations that require their staff to maintain the highest security clearances available in government (Positive Vetting) tend to have the highest gender imbalance, especially in senior management. The departments with mid-level security clearances such as PM&amp;C, DFAT and Treasury performed better on the percentages of women in senior management. The best performer in the group was the Attorney-General’s Department, whose staff hold a lower clearance and for which women make up 47 per cent of senior management<a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" title="">[147]</a>.</p>
    <p>However, there is no evidence that applications for security clearances by women are treated more harshly or have a lower success rate than those by men.<a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title="">[148]</a> The Defence Department and the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency provided detailed data as part of this study, which did not identify a gender bias in either the cancellation rate or psychological assessment results.</p>
    <p>The gender-skewed workforces in those agencies with high-level security clearances therefore originate in the pipelines – fewer women applying for these clearances and therefore these roles – rather than through a biased clearance process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>The situation in non-government organisations</h3>
    <p>Outside the public sector, the situation is little different. Few women have been appointed to the senior-most roles at major think tanks, non-government organisations or specialist university colleges. In the Australian aid community, 67 per cent of NGO employees are female, but only 34 per cent of the sector’s 56 medium and large NGOs are led by a woman.<a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" title="">[149]</a> .<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title="">[150]</a> Few females have held positions on key parliamentary oversight committees, and have almost never led them.<a href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" title="">[151]</a></p>
    <p>Of 16 university departments or research centres focusing on international or security studies, only two (Griffith Asia Institute and the Coral Bell School) are headed by a woman ..</p>
    <p>Females fare badly in the media as well. They comprise the minority (21 per cent) of sources cited in media reports, 25 per cent of sources in foreign affairs reports, and 28 per cent of opinion-piece authors, according to a 2016 study of more than 6000 articles across 6 major mastheads.<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" title="">[152]</a> Yet 59 per cent of all university graduates in Australia and close to 50 per cent of political science PhD candidates are women.<a href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" title="">[153]</a> An American study of opinion pieces on foreign policy and international security published in 2016 in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>LA Times</em>, and <em>New York Times</em> found only 15% were penned by women.<a href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" title="">[154]</a></p>
    <p>Of the major foreign policy/international security think tanks in Australia – the Lowy Institute, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Australian Institute of International Affairs (AIIA), the United States Studies Centre, and Perth USAsia Centre, only the AIIA has had a female executive head. In the magazines or blog sites published by university policy centres and think tanks, the proportion of female writers sits between 24 per cent (East Asia Forum), 28 per cent (ASPI Strategist), 30 per cent (ANU’s New Mandala) 33 per cent (ANU’s Policy Forum) and 37 per cent (Lowy Interpreter).<a href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155" title="">[155]</a> &nbsp;</p>
    <h3>A triple-threat of barriers</h3>
    <p>Our analysis suggests that there are three distinct barriers to progression for women climbing the ranks of Australia’s IR and national security organisations. Two of these are prevalent across all industries, while one appears to be unique to this sector.</p>
    <p>First, there is a <strong>vertical divide</strong>. The evidence outlined above shows that men and women in this sector are experiencing different pathways to seniority. A majority of women surveyed believe that gender has played a role in their missing out on promotions, raises or key assignments.<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" title="">[156]</a> Women are missing from the sector’s Secretary and Director-General positions, they are not selected by Government to lead or co-author key policy shaping activities, they are rarely found leading the sector’s key think-tanks and they are not heading the Parliamentary committees that oversee the country’s foreign affairs, defence, intelligence and security activities. A number of possible barriers to progression have emerged in this study: the pipeline of women shrinks as they progress through the ranks; there are fewer women coming into the STEM professions (which is particularly relevant for defence and intelligence roles – and only 16 per cent of STEM qualified professionals are female<a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157" title="">[157]</a>); there are perceived biases in processes for the promotions and overseas appointments; and cultural issues and attitudinal norms are hampering women’s progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Second, there is a <strong>horizontal divide. </strong>Women in the sector are found more commonly on the corporate, ‘people’ or ‘softer’ policy side of the house – whether that be the Secretary role in the 18 government departments, the roles in the Defence leadership team or the positions held by women in intelligence agencies. Senior women are far less likely to be running high-profile policy, operational or intelligence-focused branches and divisions. A similar division has been referred to as the ‘glass curtain’, with the ‘masculine’ roles in hard areas of security and intelligence, and ‘feminine’ roles in human rights, development and peace.<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158" title="">[158]</a> Demanding or ‘high-tempo’ policy jobs’ are often seen as male roles.<a href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159" title="">[159]</a> Some women have reported that they are told they will not get the jobs they want if they have children, many believe it will be harder to achieve management roles if they work part- time, and that if they have young families, overseas postings will be elusive.<a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" title="">[160]</a> Related to this is a de-facto security divide: with many fewer women applying for roles which require high-level security clearances (which may derive from the pipelines into these roles), the ‘hard’ agencies which require higher clearances (Defence, the intelligence agencies) are more male-skewed than others in the sector.</p>
    <p>This leads to a third, and sharp, <strong>‘international’ divide</strong> between the sexes. Relocating interstate and overseas - for both short and longer periods - is an integral part of the career path for many in this sector including academics, diplomats, intelligence officers and military. In fact, twenty-three government departments and agencies post their staff overseas, re-locating families for years at a time.<a href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" title="">[161]</a> But there is a disconnect between a government agency’s gender balance in Canberra and its overseas workforce. Calculations of the national interest also seem to affect international careers. The evidence indicates that the larger, more important or more prestigious an embassy is to Australia, the less likely that its diplomatic, defence or intelligence functions will be led by women.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Public invisibility</h3>
    <p>Women who work in this sector lack the public visibility and authority their male counterparts enjoy. Apart from the numerical under-representation in the major media mastheads described earlier, there is evidence that far fewer women are cited as ‘experts’ in foreign policy and politics than men: a King’s College London study found only 13 per cent of articles on foreign politics (including policy) cited females as expert, compared with 87 per cent citing men.<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" title="">[162]</a></p>
    <p>Women are also under-represented as authors in sector specialist publications. In academic articles in the IR sphere, women are cited less often, and in ways that do not appear to be related to differences in scholarship. Both women and men cite women less frequently, and women are cited less in the most influential articles. This citation gap disappears when an article is co-authored with a man.<a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" title="">[163]</a> In the influential digital magazines and blogs published by think tanks and universities in Australia, women publish far fewer articles as outlined above.</p>

    <p>Few women are found in senior management or on the boards of Australia’s leading international relations think tanks and university research institutes. They are also included in fewer expert discussion panels in events held by these institutions.<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title="">[164]</a> Despite social media ‘shaming’ of organisations which host all-male panels, these ‘manels’ are a hardy perennial. <a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" title="">[165]</a> Yet 87 per cent of all respondents to our survey disagreed with the statement “usually when there are panels of all-male speakers at conferences, it is because there were no women qualified for the panel.”<a href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166" title="">[166]</a></p>
    <h3>The sector lacks transparency</h3>
    <p>Some organisations in the sector have recognised the negative drivers in their organisational cultures which have held them back from attracting, promoting and retaining the most capable and diverse workforce, and they are acting to tackle this. The Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police for example, have conducted extensive culture reviews and published the results, many of which were unflattering.<a href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167" title="">[167]</a> As Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin acknowledged: “We had allowed bad behaviour to become normalised, and not to be questioned.”<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168" title="">[168]</a></p>
    <p>Few other organisations in the sector have opened themselves up to such scrutiny and have chosen rather to deal with gender issues internally. DFAT, for example, has not released the findings nor the recommendations of the 2015 independent review by Deborah May.<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" title="">[169]</a> An internal gender review examining Australia’s six intelligence agencies was conducted in 2014-15, and the findings confined within the organisations. A brief summary released several years later noted that “women are chronically under-represented in the AIC, particularly at executive level.”<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" title="">[170]</a> In our survey, 80 per cent of all respondents agreed that a lack of transparency and accountability was impeding women’s progress in the sector.</p>
    <h3>The importance of culture and leadership </h3>
    <p>Almost all (94 per cent)<a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171" title="">[171]</a> of survey respondents said that organisational culture was a factor affecting women’s progress in the sector. Some of the organisations in the sector have conducted cultural audits or diversity reviews, but many in the IR sector have not.</p>
    <p>Important changes can emerge from these public reviews. Following the 2016 AFP review, the organisation implemented a ‘blind’ recruitment process for bulk rounds at the junior executive levels in an effort to remove bias from those decisions. One ‘sworn’ recruitment round was open solely to female applicants in late 2017, aimed at the severe imbalance in the sworn officer ranks.<a href="#_ftn172" name="_ftnref172" title="">[172]</a> The 2011 Defence review prompted new levels of transparency about gender, culture and diversity issues, changes in recruitment and promotion methods and new and ambitious gender targets.</p>
    <p>There is evidence to suggest that organisational culture needs to be examined and addressed right across the sector. While not statistically conclusive, our survey found that 57 per cent (of over 400 men and women who responded to the question) reported that they been bullied or harassed on the basis of gender in the workplace.<a href="#_ftn173" name="_ftnref173" title="">[173]</a> This is a concerningly high number when compared with the public sector in general, where the level reported was 16 per cent in 2016.<a href="#_ftn174" name="_ftnref174" title="">[174]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some organisations have recognised the importance of tackling unhealthy cultures and emphasising diversity. Some organisations’ heads have shown strong leadership. The danger is that when strong leaders who have actively pursued diversity initiatives move on, the driving force behind the initiatives moves on too.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>The problems with meritocracy</h3>

      <p><em>Comments from Lowy Institute online IR gender survey, November 2016</em></p>

    <p>A key dilemma in Australia’s IR sector is the prevalent mindset – not unique to the sector – that in meritocratic workforces the best employees will succeed. That the best people will be hired through a recruitment process. But these beliefs don’t always hold true. In fact, the belief that an organisation is a meritocracy can lead to biased, non-merit based recruitment and promotions because of an over-reliance on formal evaluation and reward systems.<a href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175" title="">[175]</a></p>
    <p>Bias in the workplace affects both women and men. In Australia, for example, men are twice as likely than women to have flexible work requests denied.<a href="#_ftn176" name="_ftnref176" title="">[176]</a> Some men reported difficulties seeking additional parental leave even though almost all respondents to our survey agreed that paternity and carer’s leave arrangements are important factors in improving gender equality in an organisation.<a href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" title="">[177]</a></p>
    <p>Based on the available data, however, the biases faced by men in this sector have impeded less on their career progression. The very low proportions of women in senior positions are not simply a hangover from the now-dismantled ban on married women in the public service.<a href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" title="">[178]</a> The evidence is clear that pathways to promotion and key placements in international postings are harder for women. ‘Boys clubs’ and old school tie networks are a factor; 88 per cent of women and 67 per cent of men in our survey agreed that “hiring and promotions are too often made on the basis of networks rather than ability”.<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" title="">[179]</a> In a recent review of the public service, over half of the women surveyed in male-streamed departments said they felt “excluded from networks that are important to progression.”<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" title="">[180]</a> The results of our own online survey reinforce this, with 67 per cent of women surveyed seeing “boys club networking and decision-making” as a factor having an impact on women’s progress in the sector. Internal gender reviews in the Defence Department identified a similar issue, and as a result the Department has appointed more women as members of key committees and decision-making bodies to facilitate better networking mechanisms.<a href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181" title="">[181]</a></p>
    <p>In promotion rounds, women are more frequently judged as “aggressive” in performance reviews compared with men, a bias which can disadvantage women when assessed for promotion.<a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182" title="">[182]</a> Even women’s voices can count against them: in an experiment conducted by Harvard University’s Business School, investors were twice as likely to recommend funding a pitch narrated by a male voice than a female one, despite being identical in content.<a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183" title="">[183]</a></p>
    <p><br>One of the more significant factors impeding women’s progress, however, is family commitments.<a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" title="">[184]</a> The severe imbalance in women in the senior executive levels across the IR sector is not explained by short periods of maternity leave. The disproportionate share of domestic work and family responsibilities shouldered by women is one explanation.<a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185" title="">[185]</a> This is not unique to the sector, but its impact is compounded by the more extreme imbalance of males and females across the sector, particularly in the senior ranks and in the AIC generally. This contributes to an increased ‘masculinity’ of the workplace, adds to the likelihood of a boys’ club mentality,<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186" title="">[186]</a> and increases the risk of unconscious bias at work.<a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" title="">[187]</a> Another explanation is the assumptions employers may make about a woman’s ambitions or preferences when considering her for an international placement. In a career where international postings are critical to advancement, such biases and assumptions about women’s societal roles and personal preferences can play a significant role in the granting of those postings, and the potential impact is even more acute.<a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title="">[188]</a></p>
    <p>Finally, there are the problems of outright sexism and harassment. The risks and consequences of these in every kind of workplace and across the globe have been starkly illuminated from late 2017 with the development of the ‘Me Too’ movement. In interviews conducted by the authors, women highlighted examples of senior public servants in the IR sector accused of sexism and harassment who were simply moved or seconded to other departments within the sector rather than the complaint being dealt with directly. In some concerning cases raised with the authors some of these individuals even continued in management positions despite these complaints. Similar cases of harassment have emerged in this sector in the United States, described by one political editor as “one of the most male-dominated professions there is” and a “world that remains very much in denial about how much sex – and sexism – still shapes the … workplace”.<a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title="">[189]</a></p>
