snapshots            examining some of the more memorable meetings between Australian            prime ministers and US presidents over the years.            </div>            <div class="max_width_column">              <p>                That Scott Morrison has been granted the honour of a state visit                to Washington &ndash; the first since John Howard in 2006 and only                the second granted by the Trump administration &ndash; is a mark of                his early success in connecting with the American President, a                leader not normally known for his acoustic sensibility to close US                allies. The prime minister&rsquo;s visit will undoubtedly give a                symbolic flourish to the recent description by Secretary of State                Mike Pompeo of the US&ndash;Australia alliance as                &ldquo;unbreakable&rdquo;.<a href="notes/#notes-1" class="footnote_link">[1]</a>              </p>              <p class="keep-reading collapseomatic noarrow find-me animal-highlander_closed" id="id7219" rel="animal-highlander" tabindex="0" data-offset="" data-findme="auto"></p>            <div id="target-id7219" class="collapseomatic_content " style="display: none;">              <div class="lessons">                <p>                  Yet amid the pomp and pageantry that is the hallmark of such                  occasions, the prime minister’s visit comes at a particularly                  delicate time for his government’s management of Australian                  foreign and defence policy. The truism that Australia can                  maintain its delicate traversal of the diplomatic tightrope                  between Washington and Beijing is coming under increasing                  strain. While President Trump continues to escalate trade                  tensions with Beijing, US policy towards China remains                  unsettled, and it is not yet clear where it will come to rest                  along the spectrum from engagement to containment.                </p>                <p>                  What <em>is</em> clear, however, is that some parts of the Trump                  administration would like to see Canberra take a tougher line                  on Beijing. But the prime minister does not necessarily talk                  the same language as the Trump administration on China. The                  government has not endorsed the US National Security Strategy’s                  definition of China as a “strategic competitor”,<a href="notes/#note-2" class="footnote_link">[2]</a>                  and Morrison has consistently eschewed the hot talk of a Cold                  War–style containment policy towards the Middle Kingdom. That                  gives him an opportunity to expand on Australia’s position to                  President Trump and a range of figures across the Washington                  political community.                </p>                <p>                  At the same time, he might seize the occasion to make the case                  for why Australia and other US allies would like to see more of                  an American shoulder put to the diplomatic wheel in Southeast                  Asia. He can help reinforce to the president and his advisers                  the benefits to the region of an engaged and committed United                  States.                </p>                <p>                  The records of past meetings between Australian prime ministers                  and American presidents provide no ready-made template for the                  Morrison visit. Nevertheless, some themes do emerge and two in                  particular stand out.                </p>                <p>                  The first is that there is nothing new in leaders of the United                  States and Australia adopting contrasting positions and                  policies on how to approach challenges in Asia. Menzies and                  Kennedy, for instance, had to grapple with conflicting                  approaches to the challenge of Indonesian president Sukarno’s                  aggression towards West New Guinea and the new Malaysian                  Federation. John Gorton worried that Lyndon Johnson’s                  administration was preparing the ground for American withdrawal                  from Asia, while Nixon and Whitlam had acrimonious exchanges                  over the end of the Vietnam War and the membership and shape of                  new multilateral forums in the region.                </p>                <p>                  The second is that these occasions can prove somewhat hollow.                  French President Emmanuel Macron found that a state visit to                  Washington was no guarantee of progress on issues that mattered                  to his country or to Europe. Beyond the standard fare of                  “announceables” that accompany such visits, Prime Minister                  Morrison will be hoping his visit can achieve a genuine                  cut-through moment with Trump, not least on the need for the US                  and China to reach a resolution on their trade dispute.                  Equally, he may also be hoping that the White House does not                  press its Australian guest to abandon the measured and moderate                  tone he has adopted on China since coming to office.                </p>              </div>            </div>            <div class="pm_pics" id="pm_links">                <a data-offset="100" class="collapseomatic noarrow find-me animal-highlander_closed" rel="animal-highlander" id="pres1">                  <img alt="Robert Menzies and John F.

Kennedy, it is likely he would have much preferred to      enter an Oval Office occupied by Richard Nixon, Kennedy’s      opponent at the presidential election the previous November.      Menzies and Nixon had first met when the latter visited      Australia as Vice President in 1953, and over the next seven      years through correspondence and meetings the two had      developed a cordial relationship.    </p>    <p>      Menzies was later to openly confess that “it would have been      difficult for any American President to start, before I knew      him, further back in my estimation than John Fitzgerald      Kennedy”. Menzies recalled that Kennedy’s father, Joseph P.      Kennedy, had been tainted with the charge of appeasement when      he served as American Ambassador to Great Britain in the late      1930s. Reflecting on his first meeting with JFK, Menzies      added, “any prejudice I had was not in his favour”.<a href="notes/#note-3" class="footnote_link">[3]</a>    </p>    <p>      Menzies had also long been a sceptic of American global      leadership; indeed, of Americans in general. The conclusion      recorded in his diary at the end of his very first visit to      the United States in 1935 was that the Americans were not      “our blood cousins”, and that “overshadowing all is that I      dislike the American accent and baloney”.<a href="notes/#note-4" class="footnote_link">[4]</a>      He told Nixon in the early 1950s that the United States had      assumed unprecedented global power too early and opined to his      first Minister for External Affairs, Percy Spender, that the      ANZUS treaty would be “a superstructure on a foundation of      jelly”.<a href="notes/#note-5" class="footnote_link">[5]</a>      Throughout his first decade in power, Menzies had also shown a      capacity to challenge US policy, urging a more restrained      American response to the crises across the Taiwan Strait,      maintaining a profitable trading relationship with Beijing in      non-strategic goods, and backing Britain, not the United      States, in the Suez crisis of 1956.    </p>    <p>      Menzies’ call on Kennedy in February 1961 was an informal      visit: the Australian leader was en route to a Commonwealth      Prime Ministers conference in London that was to take place      the following month. The new president hosted Menzies at a      private working lunch with Secretary of State Dean Rusk,      Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific      Affairs JG Parsons, and Australian Ambassador Howard Beale.      One US official recalled the lunch as a “memorable occasion”      that had been:    </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        …completely informal, completely relaxed … Two of the greatest        spellbinders that I had ever encountered were the principals. Menzies is        just a fascinating figure and a man of immense stature — he would have        been in any country, let alone Australia — and a very colourful and        persuasive talker and relater of anecdotes. And, of course, the President        … a man of great humour, great presence, great wit.<a href="notes/"class="footnote_link">[6]</a>      </p>    </blockquote>    <p>     The two leaders also discussed the legacy of the Second     World War, most particularly Kennedy’s military service in     the Pacific.   </p>   <p>    But there was also business to discuss. Although US officials    told Kennedy that there were “no important problems in …    bilateral relations with Australia”, describing Menzies as a    “strong friend of the US, and a fervent Anglophile”, the two    leaders did focus on the festering problem of Indonesian    president Sukarno’s claims on the Dutch-held territory of    West New Guinea. For Sukarno it would be the final step in    the completion of the Indonesian state.  </p>  <p>    Australia favoured either the Dutch retaining control or    that the West Papuans be given an exercise of    self-determination. Washington recognised that Sukarno’s    hold on government was a fine balancing act and feared that    if he did not get his way over West New Guinea, then the    Indonesian Communist Party may seize leadership of the    national cause and possibly overthrow him.

It would “supplement” rather      than “duplicate” the ambit of the United Nations and      other international organisations. As historian Timothy      Maga has argued, the idea was for this new body to be      headquartered in Australia: the White House’s way of      trying to encourage Australia into a more “active,      interventionist foreign policy based on American goals in      the Cold War”. But Menzies would not sign up to this part      of Kennedy’s new frontier, fearing that the idea was      attempting to manoeuver Australia into a ‘spokesman’ role      for American policy in Asia and the Pacific. The      Australian reluctance to take up the mantle envisaged for      it by the president was not received well in Washington.      As Maga concluded:    </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        Kennedy’s … discovery that Australia could say ‘no’ and        still remain a friend to American policy must have been        an amazing, hard-in-coming revelation for him.<a href="notes/#note-9" class="footnote_link">[9]</a>      </p>    </blockquote>  </div></div><div id="target-pres2" class="collapseomatic_content" style="display: none;">  <img src="assets/gorton_johnson_header.jpg" class="pm_header_pic">  <div class="header_pic_credit">Image: John Gorton and Lyndon Baines Johnson</div>  <div class="pm_ind_title">    <span class="PM_name_title">John Gorton</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_and_title">and</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_name_title">Lyndon Baines Johnson</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_date_title">May 1968</span>  </div>  <div class="pm_width">    <p>      Prime Minister John Gorton’s first visit to Washington in May 1968 took      place against the background of a worsening situation in Vietnam and a      swelling anti-war protest movement in both Australia and the United States.      On becoming prime minister, Gorton had said that Australia would not      increase its commitment of manpower to the war. After President Lyndon      Baines Johnson’s speech in March 1968, which announced a unilateral      limitation on the bombing of North Vietnam, Gorton grumbled about the lack      of consultation with Australia on Vietnam policy and cast doubt on      America’s commitment to Asia. It was “no way to treat an ally” he said.<a      href="notes/#note-10" class="footnote_link">[10]</a>    </p>    <p>      The Americans had doubts about Gorton. “Behind the crumpled nose which      makes him look like an ex-prize fighter”, one US brief noted before      Gorton went to Washington, was a leader they saw as “not a profound      thinker … a conclusion jumper” and one “who lacks experience in      foreign affairs”.<a href="notes/#note-11" class="footnote_link">[11]</a>    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, Gorton was eager to replicate the intimacy of the      Holt–Johnson relationship. The Americans received a most unusual request      from the Australian side. Aware that on Holt’s last visit to the White      House in July 1967 the president had departed from the schedule to share a      casual sandwich with him in a small room adjacent to the Oval Office,      Gorton was hoping for a similar invitation. Indeed, the Australian embassy      even cancelled a lunch invitation from the US Secretary of State, “just in      case the president should wish to extend the meeting” beyond the allotted      hour. The prime minister’s desperation, recalled Australia’s ambassador in      Washington Keith Waller, “was one of those agonies to which ambassadors are      exposed from time to time”.<a href="notes/#note-12" class="footnote_link">[12]</a>      The Australian embassy apparently made it clear that Gorton’s ego would be      bruised if “he didn’t get some of the Holt treatment”. According to Walt      Rostow, Johnson’s special assistant for national security affairs, it was      evident that the Australians were “hoping for another sandwich” and a      “spontaneous show of instant fellowship”.<a href="notes/#note-13" class="footnote_link">[13]</a>    </p>    <p>      In the end, the presidential sandwich eluded Gorton. But he was certainly      accorded the VIP treatment — with Air Force One being sent to Honolulu to      bring him to Washington (“He was already one up on Holt there”, Waller      recalled). There was also an invitation to dinner on the presidential yacht      Sequoia, an impromptu breakfast with Johnson, and a weekend sojourn at the      LBJ Ranch in Texas where he was briefed by the commander of US military      operations in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland.    </p>    <div class="pm_slider_howard"><img src="assets/gorton_johnson2.jpg" class="large_image_pm">      <p class="image_source_field">        <em>Image: John Gorton &amp; Lyndon Baines Johnson</em>      </p>    </div>    <p>      Gorton, however, was hard to please. It had all started badly on the cruise      down the Potomac River. Gorton had been summoned to the boat almost      immediately after arriving in Washington, and the invitation was deemed an      “unexampled honour”. Yet in the words of Waller, “a more uncomfortable      first meeting between two men I have never seen”. The leaders sat alone on      the stern but as the vessel chugged down the river, “having to shout      against the noise of the motor and the noise of the wind, conversation      wasn’t terribly easy”. Johnson and Gorton were locked in a “conversational      embrace … like a Marx Brothers film”.<a href="notes/#note-14" class="footnote_link">[14]</a> As a metaphor for an alliance attempting to      chart other more troubled waters at the time, it could hardly be    bettered.</p>    <p>      According to his private secretary, Ainslie Gotto, Gorton was      “tremendously impressed” with the welcome mat rolled out in Washington      and on the LBJ ranch in Texas, but he remained “extremely nervous about      Australian public reaction to that treatment”, fearing “it would appear      as if he was being bought”. Gotto complained that Gorton had read few of      the briefs prepared by his officials, and stayed up so late each night      that “after several days he was so groggy that his public speaking      performances were affected”.<a href="notes/#note-15" class="footnote_link">[15]</a> The pressure on the prime minister was      taking its toll. Waller also detected the strain: though Gorton was      flattered by the “honours and attention” from the president, he “soon      sensed that the President was bent on ‘annexing him’”, as if, Gorton had      said, “I were a piece of colonial territory”. Far from finding the      privileged access exhilarating, Gorton felt the opposite, telling Waller      that he found Johnson “much too demanding”. The Australian leader said      all the right things in public, but the lack of rapport in his private      dealings with Johnson sprang “in large part from his feeling that he was      being ‘captured’”.<a href="notes/#note-16" class="footnote_link">[16]</a>    </p>    <p>      Gorton, however, left Washington empty-handed. He arrived seeking a      guarantee from the Americans about their commitment to Australian security      under the terms of the ANZUS treaty — and specifically as to whether      American military aid would be forthcoming should Australian forces get      into trouble in Malaysia and Singapore after the British withdrawal. But      the Americans, as they had done before, would have none of it, telling the      Australian leader that he should not even mention ANZUS publicly in this      way. As his foreign affairs adviser, Alan Griffith, remarked on returning      to Canberra, the whole visit had been a “bit of a disaster”, not least      because Gorton had “overplayed his mission of sounding out US intentions in    Asia”. It was apparent to the Australian press, Griffith noted: </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        …that the President and others had turned the tables on [Gorton] by        pointing out that it was for Australia and other Asian powers to set        the course in Asia; the US performance in that area would depend upon        Australia and others carrying at least a fair share of the burden.<a        href="notes/#note-17" class="footnote_link">[17]</a>      </p>    </blockquote>  </div></div><div id="target-pres3" class="collapseomatic_content" style="">  <img src="assets/mcmahon_nixon_header.jpg" class="pm_header_pic">  <div class="header_pic_credit">Image: Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Archives  </div>  <div class="pm_ind_title"><span class="PM_name_title">William McMahon</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_and_title">and</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_name_title">Richard Nixon</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_date_title">November 1971</span>  </div>  <div class="pm_width">    <p>      The atmosphere surrounding William McMahon’s call on President Richard Nixon      towards the end of 1971 was one of barely concealed frustration. Earlier that      year, McMahon had been publicly embarrassed by Nixon’s historic shift on      China policy. The US president had announced that he would visit Beijing.      Opposition leader Gough Whitlam had also been in Beijing only days before the      arrival of Nixon’s National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger. McMahon had      attempted to make Whitlam look like a puppet of the Chinese, but the joke was      very quickly on the prime minister. In a flash, what had been an article of      faith for conservative Cold War politics — the fear of China or the ‘red      peril’ — became a symbol of outdated politics.    </p>    <p>      McMahon’s disappointment with Nixon’s failure to warn him of the change in      US China policy culminated in a bitter letter of complaint to the      president, in which he bemoaned the lack of “foreknowledge” of at least the      broad trends of American policies. McMahon added that Australia had been      “placed in a quandary” by this dramatic step, “the more so because we have      attempted under all circumstances to co-ordinate our policies and support      you in what you are doing”.<a href="notes/#note-18" class="footnote_link">[18]</a>      Of course, the Australians were by no means the only ones excluded from the      administration’s thinking on this question. Nixon’s Secretary of State,      William Rogers, senior Republicans on Capitol Hill, and even the US      president’s closest Asian ally, Japanese leader Eisaku Sato, had not been      given prior warning. US officials reported that McMahon was in a “nervous      state” and the editor of the Canberra Times, John Allan, told the US      embassy that the prime minister was “almost psychotic” about being      humiliated not only by the American president but also by      Whitlam.<a href="notes/#note-19" class="footnote_link">[19]</a>    </p>    <p>      At a speech in Sydney to the American National Club in late July 1971,      McMahon could no longer contain his outrage. In remarks laced with      “unmistakable sarcasm” concerning the Nixon announcement, McMahon not only      referred to the “sweet letter” he had received from the president      explaining the need for secrecy about the move, but speculated that he      “wouldn’t be surprised if [Chinese premier] Chou En-Lai didn’t get the best      of President Nixon which in turn will adversely affect Nixon’s election      chances in 1972”.<a href="notes/#note-20" class="footnote_link">[20]</a> Such a      public assessment of US domestic politics was all the more remarkable given      that McMahon had excoriated Whitlam for daring to suggest to the Chinese      premier during his visit to Beijing earlier in the year that Nixon’s      Vietnam policies, like those of Lyndon Baines Johnson, might well be his      electoral undoing.    </p>    <div class="pm_slider_howard"><img src="assets/mcmahon_nixon_lowy_institute_pms_washington.jpg" class="large_image_pm">    </div>    <p class="image_source_field">      <em>McMahon’s Washington visit. Image: Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Archives</em>    </p>    <p>      Much repair work, then, was needed when McMahon arrived in Washington in      November 1971. The Australian prime minister, however, was singing from      the oldest of ANZUS song sheets: pleading for yet another security      guarantee from his hosts. During his meeting with Secretary of State      William Rogers, McMahon said that the best thing the president could do      to help was to “declare that [the] ANZUS treaty is as important now as      [the] day it was signed”.<a href="notes/#note-21" class="footnote_link">[21]</a>    </p>    <p>      Nixon didn’t quite go that far — although in his toast to the visiting      Australian he stressed that the treaty was “one of the fundamental      pillars of our policy of peace in the Pacific” and that it went “far      beyond simply that piece of paper”. He was happy “to reiterate that      support and that commitment”. The language was strong but essentially      theoretical and lacked what McMahon most wanted — a touch of the      definitive. And so if the president would not say the magic words,      McMahon would do it for him. In his reply to Nixon, he hinted at a      more independent role for Australia in Southeast Asia, but went on to      add that it rested on a    </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        …basis of security … the guarantee and the assurance from you and from        your administration that the ANZUS treaty is as sacred today and as        valid today as when it was first signed a few years ago by Mr Dulles        and our own foreign minister, Sir Percy Spender.<a href="notes/#note-22" class="footnote_link">[22]</a>      </p>    </blockquote>    <p>      But the “red carpet treatment”, according to US official reports, had      worked. On his return to Australia, McMahon duly thanked the president      not only for talks which “took place at a formative stage of decision      making”, but also the “robust reaffirmation of the ANZUS treaty” and for      making “Blair House available to us”. As a further concession to      Australian protests over the lack of consultation on China, the Nixon      administration had agreed to the establishment of a secret ‘hotline’      between the White House in Washington and the Lodge in Canberra, but it      was apparently used only five times in its thirteen-month life — and      mainly to convey birthday wishes.<a href="notes/#note-23" class="footnote_link">[23]</a>    </p>    <p>      McMahon’s visit was subsequently remembered for just one thing: the dress      split to the thighs and armpits and held together by rhinestones that his      wife Sonia wore at the official state dinner. Nearly four years later, as      Washington was receiving news about an ailing Labor government in      November 1975, Kissinger asked senior officers in the State Department      who might become the new leader. He confessed that he had great      difficulty remembering the identity of the “last conservative prime      minister” in Australia. Nor could his advisers, until one of them      suddenly recalled: it was “the guy with the wife — McMahon”.<a      href="notes/#note-24" class="footnote_link">[24]</a>    </p>  </div></div><div id="target-pres4" class="collapseomatic_content" style="display: none;">  <img src="assets/whitlam_nixon_header.jpg" class="pm_header_pic">  <div class="header_pic_credit">Image: Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Archives  </div>  <div class="pm_ind_title"><span class="PM_name_title">Gough Whitlam</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_and_title">and</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_name_title">Richard Nixon</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_date_title">July 1973</span>  </div>  <div class="pm_width">    <p>      Even before he became prime minister, Gough Whitlam had clear ideas about      how an Australian leader’s visit to Washington should transpire. In      opposition he had expressed his distaste for what he called “coronations”      on the South Lawn of the White House. He believed that the relationship had      become too captive of the relations between leaders and that “adherence to      ANZUS does not constitute a foreign policy”. Only weeks after becoming      prime minister, his first test in the alliance would come. It would be      brutal. Following his condemnation of President Nixon’s so-called      ‘Christmas bombings’ of North Vietnam in December 1972, and in light of      Whitlam’s belief that Australia could have an Asia policy outside the      framework of the US alliance, Nixon and his National Security Advisor,      Henry Kissinger, were in no mood to issue an official invitation for      Whitlam to visit. This despite the fact that they were preparing to welcome      the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at around      the same time.<a href="notes/#note-25" class="footnote_link">[25]</a>    </p>    <p>      For the first five months of 1973, the Nixon White House put Australia in      the diplomatic deep freeze. Whitlam, initially, was in denial and became      somewhat impatient with the constant press speculation about whether or not      he would be received by Nixon. He even expressed the view that it should be      possible “without formal planning for the Prime Minister to stop for a chat      at the White House”. All this “hoohah”, he added, that “has accompanied      visits by Sir Robert Menzies’ successors, is sycophantic”.<a href="notes/#note-26" class="footnote_link">[26]</a>    </p>    <p>      But the snub became such a sensitive issue for Whitlam domestically that he      was forced to send his private secretary, Peter Wilenski, to Washington to      meet with Kissinger, clear the air, and press for a White House invitation.      Deputy Prime Minister Lance Barnard also pleaded with the new American      Ambassador, Marshall Green, to resolve the matter, as it had become an      “emotional issue” in Australia with “average Australians” now concerned      about the state of the relationship. Opposition leader Billy Snedden wrote      to Nixon imploring him to invite Whitlam for the sake of the alliance’s      future.<a href="notes/#note-27" class="footnote_link">[27]</a>    </p>    <p>      Nixon finally agreed to the Whitlam meeting through clenched teeth.      Kissinger had stressed that such an encounter was needed to “keep Whitlam      in line” on Asia policy. And Marshall Green believed the delay in extending      the White House invitation had made the Labor leader “sweat a bit”, arguing      that now was the time to try to “broaden” Whitlam’s regional vision. The      White House briefing notes prepared for the Whitlam visit were full of the      relish senior Nixon aides felt at the prospect of their president      delivering the Australian leader a lecture on how the world really works.<a      href="notes/#note-28" class="footnote_link">[28]</a>    </p>    <div class="pm_slider_howard">      <div style="max-width: 600px;" class="metaslider metaslider-flex metaslider-164 ml-slider nav-hidden nav-hidden">        <div id="metaslider_container_164">          <div id="metaslider_164" class="flexslider">            <ul class="slides">              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 1; z-index: 2;" class="slide-166 ms-image flex-active-slide"><img src="assets/nixon_whitlam_lowy_pms_pres_slide1.jpg" height="800" width="600" alt="" class="slider-164 slide-166" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-168 ms-image"><img src="assets/nixon_whitlam_lowy_pms_pres_slide2.jpg" height="800" width="600" alt="" class="slider-164 slide-168" draggable="false"></li>            </ul>            <ul class="flex-direction-nav">              <li><a class="flex-prev" href="#">&lt;</a></li>              <li><a class="flex-next" href="#">&gt;</a></li>            </ul>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <p class="image_source_field">      <em>Images from Whitlam’s visit to Washington.

Now was not the time, he      told his guest, for flirtation with new ideas of regional cooperation or      zones of peace. There was a need to resist the isolationist trends in    public opinion. As Nixon put it: </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        Suppose we were to face another crisis in Berlin or the Middle East, our        intellectuals would demand that we stay out of these affairs and we would        have a hard time exercising influence. Thus we really have to decide        whether we are going to opt out of the world.      </p>    </blockquote>    <p>      Nixon told Whitlam he had “never met an Aussie [he] didn’t like”, but his      message was clear — any Australian withdrawal from military commitments      in Malaysia and Singapore, for instance, could have “tragic      consequences”. Whitlam’s response was one of reassurance, telling the      president that “it is widely understood that Australia’s effectiveness in      its relations with Asia depends upon a reputation for good relations with      the US”.<a href="notes/#note-32" class="footnote_link">[32]</a>    </p>    <p>      In public, however, Whitlam kept to his theme of updating the alliance for      the new times. During his speech to the National Press Club, which came      immediately after his meeting with Nixon, Whitlam reaffirmed that ANZUS was      not the “be-all and end-all” of the relationship and that it should not be      the only significant factor in Australia’s relations with the United      States. He rejected as “absurd” the idea that his country was “moving into      a different ideological orbit”. Rather “what we are trying to do is break      out of a kind of ideological isolationism which has limited the conduct of      our affairs in the past”. Giving voice to his own view that the region      around Australia should be kept free of superpower rivalry, he emphasised      that “in our dealings with all the countries of that region we think it is      time for an ideological holiday”. In his address, Whitlam came to the heart      of the new relationship:    </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        …we are not a satellite of any country. We are a friend and partner of        the United States particularly in the Pacific but with independent        interests of our own.<a href="notes/#note-33" class="footnote_link">[33]</a>      </p>    </blockquote>  </div></div><div id="target-pres5" class="collapseomatic_content" style="display: none;">  <img src="assets/howard_bush_header.jpg" class="pm_header_pic">  <div class="header_pic_credit">Image: Stephen Jaffe / Getty Images  </div>  <div class="pm_ind_title"><span class="PM_name_title">John Howard</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_and_title">and</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_name_title">George W.

Howard came to the conclusion that the “personal relationship      between the American president and me would become the closest of any      between the respective heads of government of the two countries”.<a      href="notes/#note-34" class="footnote_link">[34]</a>    </p>    <p>      However, on the Sunday before the 9/11 attacks, Howard could be accused of      struggling to articulate the meaning of the alliance. On 9 September, the      prime minister hosted a barbecue for the Washington political elite at the      residence of the Australian Ambassador, Michael Thawley. A third of the Bush      Cabinet were present that evening, including Vice President Dick Cheney and      Secretary of State Colin Powell, as well as two Supreme Court Justices and      the then nominee for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    </p>    <p>      When his turn came to speak to the gathered dignitaries, Howard compared      the alliance to the weather: “When I think of the relationship I can’t do      any better than sort of imagine this evening. A beautiful balmy evening.      This could be Sydney or Brisbane or Perth in January or February. It’s a      glorious balmy evening.” No relationship, he continued, was “more natural,      more easy and one more deeply steeped in shared experience and common      aspiration”.<a href="notes/#note-35" class="footnote_link">[35]</a> As Peter      Hartcher concluded, Howard “gave every appearance of doing what the US      itself is often accused of doing with the alliance — taking it for      granted”.<a href="notes/#note-36" class="footnote_link">[36]</a>    </p>    <p>      In their official talks, which were preceded by a ceremony at the naval      dockyard to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the ANZUS      treaty — a “spick and span turnout from the US military on a clear and      beautiful Washington day” as Howard recalled — the two leaders recommitted      to the alliance. Howard put a free trade agreement with the United States      on the agenda, reminding Bush of the continued harm that American      protective tariffs inflicted on Australia’s agricultural sector. Bush, for      his part, made much of his attempt to restart the US–Russia relationship      via his supposed close relationship with Vladimir Putin.<a href="notes/#note-38" class="footnote_link">[38]</a>    </p>    <p>    </p><div class="pm_slider_howard">      <div style="max-width: 510px;" class="metaslider metaslider-flex metaslider-127 ml-slider nav-hidden nav-hidden nav-hidden">        <div id="metaslider_container_127">          <div id="metaslider_127" class="flexslider">            <ul class="slides">              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 1; z-index: 2;" class="slide-129 ms-image flex-active-slide"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide_2001_1.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-127 slide-129" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-133 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide_2001_2.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-127 slide-133" draggable="false"></li>            </ul>            <ul class="flex-direction-nav">              <li><a class="flex-prev" href="#">&lt;</a></li>              <li><a class="flex-next" href="#">&gt;</a></li>            </ul>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <p class="image_source_field">      <em>Images from Howard’s 2001 visit to Washington.

Much of this can be      attributed to his presence in Washington on the day of the terrorist attacks      on New York and the Pentagon. Being in Washington, he wrote later, “meant      that I absorbed, immediately, the shocked disbelief, anger and all of the      other emotions experienced by the American people”. In the space of 24 hours,      he noted, “the psychology of the American people was transformed”. At a press      conference in the grounds of the ambassador’s residence, he declared that      “Australia will provide all support that might be requested of us by the      United States in relation to any action that might be taken”, words that      would ultimately see Australian military commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq.      It was time, Howard would later say, for Australia to be a “100 per cent      ally, not a 70 or 80 per cent one”. He was sure that the “gratitude of the      American people for the speed and unconditional character of our response      remains to this day”.<a href="notes/#note-39" class="footnote_link">[39]</a>    </p>    <p>      On the day following the attacks, Howard attended a special sitting of      Congress (he had been due to deliver an address there on 12      September) at which resolutions condemning the attacks and      discussing possible responses were the subject of debate. As the      only foreign leader present in the public gallery, his presence      on the occasion drew a standing ovation from those below. There      can be little doubt of the impact this had on Howard: he      subsequently confessed to being “quite emotional…at that time, in      those circumstances to be in the capital of the United States to      convey the sympathy and support of the Australian people. Tragic      as the circumstances were, I felt especially privileged to be      there.”    </p>    <div class="pm_slider_howard">      <div style="max-width: 510px;" class="metaslider metaslider-flex metaslider-94 ml-slider nav-hidden nav-hidden nav-hidden nav-hidden">        <div id="metaslider_container_94">          <div id="metaslider_94" class="flexslider">            <ul class="slides">              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 1; z-index: 2;" class="slide-111 ms-image flex-active-slide"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide4.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-111" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-113 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide1.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-113" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-115 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide2.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-115" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-117 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide3.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-117" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-119 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide5.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-119" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-121 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide7.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-121" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-123 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide8.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-123" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-125 ms-image"><img src="assets/john_howard_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide9.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-94 slide-125" draggable="false"></li>            </ul>            <ul class="flex-direction-nav">              <li><a class="flex-prev" href="#">&lt;</a></li>              <li><a class="flex-next" href="#">&gt;</a></li>            </ul>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <p class="image_source_field">      <em>Images from Howard’s 2003 and 2008 Washington visits. Source: George W.

The move was widely interpreted as a gesture of      solidarity that came in the wake of the invocation of NATO. The      Australian decision was subsequently confirmed at a special sitting      of the federal Cabinet held on Howard’s return. Speaking to      journalists following the announcement, he said that it has “both a      symbolic resonance but it also means something in substance and it      does mean that if there is action taken then we will naturally      consider any requests from the Americans for      assistance”.<a href="notes/#note-40" class="footnote_link">[40]</a>    </p>    <p>      From the time of this visit Howard claimed the alliance as his own. The      Australian would later describe Bush and Howard as “hyper-powered mates”.<a      href="notes/#note-41" class="footnote_link">[41]</a> Perhaps of far greater import was      the conclusion Howard reached as a result of his support for the US-led ‘war on    terror’. He was emboldened to make the claim that: </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        …the American alliance is going to get more important as the years go by. I        mean, America’s power is going to grow. America is getting stronger        economically, not weaker. A lot of the assumptions some people made about        Australian alliances were posited on 1990s views about growth and military        power and influence, and they have been proved wrong.<a href="notes/#note-42" class="footnote_link">[42]</a>      </p>    </blockquote>    <p>      By the time his prime ministership was over, however, Howard’s close      relationship with Bush had become something of an electoral      liability.    </p>  </div></div><div id="target-pres6" class="collapseomatic_content" style="display: none;">  <img src="assets/rudd_bush_header.jpg" class="pm_header_pic">  <div class="header_pic_credit"> Image: Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images  </div>  <div class="pm_ind_title"><span class="PM_name_title">Kevin Rudd</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_and_title">and</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_name_title">George W.

But for Rudd the spectre of one of his predecessors as Labor leader, Mark      Latham, loomed equally large. Latham’s strident criticism of Bush, and in      particular his opposition to the war in Iraq, had allowed Howard to attack Labor    as untrustworthy on national security and weak on the US alliance.</p>    <p>      Accordingly, Rudd set out for the American capital determined to showcase      Labor’s alliance credentials, establish an independent Australian position on      key policies — especially Iraq and climate change — and, to some extent,      depersonalise the alliance. Australians, observed the Economist in late 2007,      “wanted to see clear blue water between their country and the American      flagship”.<a href="notes/#note-43" class="footnote_link">[43]</a>    </p>    <p>      Rudd’s strategy, however, put history first. It worked. During his press      conference with President Bush, Rudd recounted how he had been shown John      Curtin’s signature in the guest book at Blair House, the residence across from      the White House reserved for visiting VIPs. Rudd said that seeing Curtin’s      autograph on the morning of his official talks with Bush underlined to him “how      much this alliance has been the product of common nurturing by Presidents and      Prime Ministers for a long time”.<a href="notes/#note-44" class="footnote_link">[44]</a> The remarks carried a generous bipartisan tone,      but they also prioritised the past over personality.    </p>    <p>      As journalist Tony Walker remarked at the time, “if there is one overriding      lesson to be learned from the past seven years, it is the undesirability of      personalising an alliance relationship”. Or as the Lowy Institute’s Michael      Fullilove noted, the atmospherics at the press conference were more      “businesslike” than those involving Howard and Bush. There was “less      clenching of the jaw and squaring of the shoulders; fewer misty looks into      the middle distance”. Rudd called Bush ‘George’ and labelled him an “honorary      Queenslander”. Bush called his visitor a “fine lad” and a “straightforward      fella”, leading the Washington Post to conclude that the two had established      a “burgeoning diplomatic relationship”.<a href="notes/#note-45" class="footnote_link">[45]</a>    </p>    <div class="pm_slider_howard">      <div style="max-width: 510px;" class="metaslider metaslider-flex metaslider-140 ml-slider nav-hidden nav-hidden nav-hidden nav-hidden nav-hidden">        <div id="metaslider_container_140">          <div id="metaslider_140" class="flexslider">            <ul class="slides">              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 1; z-index: 2;" class="slide-143 ms-image flex-active-slide"><img src="assets/kevin_rudd_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide_2008_1.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-140 slide-143" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-145 ms-image"><img src="assets/kevin_rudd_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide_2008_2.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-140 slide-145" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-147 ms-image"><img src="assets/kevin_rudd_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide_2008_3.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-140 slide-147" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-149 ms-image"><img src="assets/kevin_rudd_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide_2008_4.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-140 slide-149" draggable="false"></li>              <li style="display: block; width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: -100%; position: relative; opacity: 0; z-index: 1;" class="slide-151 ms-image"><img src="assets/kevin_rudd_george_bush_lowy_institute_slide_2008_5.jpg" height="330" width="510" alt="" class="slider-140 slide-151" draggable="false"></li>            </ul>            <ul class="flex-direction-nav">              <li><a class="flex-prev" href="#">&lt;</a></li>              <li><a class="flex-next" href="#">&gt;</a></li>            </ul>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <p class="image_source_field">      <em>Images from Rudd’s 2008 Washington visit. Source: George W. Bush Presidential Library</em>    </p>    <p>      In Washington, Bush publicly endorsed Rudd’s decision to withdraw Australian      combat troops from Iraq as a measure not only of the Australian leader’s      commitment to meeting his election promises, but, more dubiously, as a mark      that the situation on the ground in Iraq was improving. The Australian      withdrawal, said Bush, was “a return on success”. Rudd also won praise for      reaffirming that Australia would be in Afghanistan for the “long haul”. But      as US Ambassador to Australia Robert McCallum warned the State Department in      a confidential diplomatic cable before the visit, there were some niggles.      The United States had been alarmed that Canberra had chosen to tell China      “before telling us of their opposition to continuing quadrilateral      discussions between the US, Australia, Japan and      India”.<a href="notes/#note-46" class="footnote_link">[46]</a> They were also disappointed that Rudd had      chosen to visit Beijing before Tokyo. But the two leaders did try to maintain      a balance in their approach to China, expressing strong displeasure with      Beijing’s crackdown on Tibetan protesters while at the same time trying not      to alienate a crucial economic partner.    </p>    <p>      But the euphoria was short lived. Rudd’s visit to Washington might have      been “all very jolly”, to quote journalist Michelle Grattan,      with Rudd winning his “alliance spurs”, but by the time he was      caught on camera a few days later saluting Bush at a NATO      summit in Bucharest, critics were quick to pounce. Opposition      leader Brendon Nelson labelled it “conduct unbecoming of an      Australian prime minister” while the Greens’ Bob Brown classified it as a “huge mistake” that “belittled” Australia      and “reminds us of John Howard and his deputy sheriff gaffe      back in 2003”.<a href="notes/#note-47" class="footnote_link">[47]</a>    </p>    <p>      Later in the year much of the goodwill generated between the two leaders      dissipated with reports that Rudd allowed newspaper editor Chris      Mitchell to listen in on a confidential telephone conversation      with the president. An article about the conversation reported      that Rudd had been “stunned to hear Bush say, ‘What’s the G20?’”      in reference to a future gathering of world leaders. As the US      ambassador reported back to Washington at the time:    </p>    <blockquote>      <p>        Rudd’s refusal to deny that his office was the source of the leak …        confirmed to most Canberra observers that he showed exceptionally poor        judgment in trying to aggrandise himself at the expense of Australia’s        most important relationship.<a href="notes/#note-48" class="footnote_link">[48]</a>      </p>    </blockquote>    <p>      American displeasure ultimately took the form of the diplomatic cold      shoulder Bush offered to Rudd at the G20 Summit in November 2008. By that      time, the mellow rhetoric of March had well and truly receded into the      diplomatic mist.    </p>  </div></div><div id="target-pres7" class="collapseomatic_content" style="display: none;">  <img src="assets/turnbull_trump_header.jpg" class="pm_header_pic">  <div class="header_pic_credit"> Image: The White House / Flickr</div>  <div class="pm_ind_title"><span class="PM_name_title">Malcolm Turnbull</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_and_title">and</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_name_title">Donald Trump</span>    <br>    <span class="PM_date_title">May 2017</span>  </div>  <div class="pm_width"> <p>  Most, if not all, prime ministerial visits to the United States since the end  of the Second World War have involved ringing declarations of shared military  sacrifice over the preceding century.

To mark the occasion, Turnbull and Trump  met on board the USS <em>Intrepid</em>, now a museum moored on the Hudson  River.

That deal held that  around 1200 asylum seekers then in Australian offshore detention centres on  Manus Island and Nauru were to be resettled in the United States.</p><p>  The <em>Washington Post</em> called it the phone call that &ldquo;reverberated  around the world&rdquo;.<a href="notes/#note-49" class="footnote_link">[49]</a>  Trump abruptly ended the call (the president was not disposed to honour the  deal, although he ultimately did) and then took to Twitter, compounding the  problem by airing his contempt for the deal and insulting the Australian prime  minister. That a US president could so caustically disparage his telephone  conversation with Turnbull as the &ldquo;worst call by far&rdquo; of the  day<a href="notes/#note-50" class="footnote_link">[50]</a> &ndash; this  coming not long after he had spoken with foreign leaders such as Russian  President Vladimir Putin &ndash; left many Australians scratching their heads.</p><p>  Then a transcript of the conversation was leaked to the American media.<a  href="notes/#note-51" class="footnote_link">[51]</a> Such treatment of Prime  Minister Turnbull by a fledgling Trump White House seemed for a moment to  confirm all the worst fears about how the new president would handle the  management of key US alliances, especially in Asia. The fallout saw some  panicked analysts calling for Australia to have a &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; in the  event that Trump inflicted further damage on alliance relations.</p><p>  At their meeting in New York, Trump and Turnbull apparently had a brief  discussion about their respective experiences in business, but substantive  outcomes were hard to find. Still, the overwhelming feeling in Canberra and  among many commentators was sheer relief. In this view, the alliance had been  successfully &lsquo;reset&rsquo;. This said much more about the short-termism  informing much contemporary analysis of the relationship, for this fracas was a  long way from the kinds of disagreements Australian prime ministers have had  with American presidents in the past.</p><p>  Australia’s emphasis on “100 years of mateship” at the Intrepid event might  well have been tailor-made for this particular Trumpian moment:  the thinking being that the best way to handle the president&rsquo;s  unpredictability and inexperience on the world stage was to smother him in a  heroic retelling of US&ndash;Australian history, leaving issues of substance to  the senior policy professionals.</p><p>  It also showed that Prime Minister Turnbull had long lost his healthy  scepticism about the relationship with Washington. Before arriving at the  Lodge, Turnbull warned &ldquo;extravagant professions of loyalty and devotion  to the United States&rdquo; were simply unnecessary.<a href="notes/#note-52" class="footnote_link">[52]</a>  Australia&rsquo;s job, according to the earlier  Turnbull, was to prevent US&ndash;China competition from spiralling out of  control and towards military conflict.&nbsp;It is not often recalled that at  the end of that spirited phone call in January, Turnbull reassured Trump that  &ldquo;you can count on me&rdquo;.<a href="notes/#note-53" class="footnote_link">[53]</a>  The White House extracted no <em>quid pro  quo</em> from the Australian Government for its decision to proceed with the  refugee deal, but later that year Turnbull expressed the view that  Australia&rsquo;s ANZUS obligations would come into effect in the case of  clear-cut North Korean aggression against the United States.&nbsp;In effect, he  needlessly diminished Australia&rsquo;s freedom of manoeuvre in the event of  conflict, thus giving the Americans a blank cheque.</p><p>  Despite the seeming success of this New York meeting, welcomed by alliance  sentimentalists as a reaffirmation of all that the ANZUS Treaty stands for,  risks remained. It projected a view of the relationship that at times remains  too tightly moored to memory, one still failing to directly engage in the more  difficult conversations about what the American posture in Asia will look like  in the years ahead, and what that means for Australia.</p>  </div></div><div class="footer">  <div class="copyright">Copyright © 2019 Lowy Institute  </div>  <div class="footer_social">    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LowyInstitute" target="_blank"><img width="20" height="20" src="assets/footer-facebook.png" class="footer_social_links"></a>    <a href="https://twitter.com/LowyInstitute" target="_blank"><img width="20" height="20" src="assets/footer-twitter.png" class="footer_social_links"></a>    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/457230" target="_blank"><img width="20" height="20" src="assets/footer-linkedin.png" class="footer_social_links"></a>    <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/rss.xml" target="_blank"><img width="20" height="20" src="assets/footer-rss.png" class="footer_social_links"></a>  </div></div><div id="wpfront-scroll-top-container"><img src="assets/arrow-top.png" alt="Go to top"></div><script type="text/javascript">function wpfront_scroll_top_init() {if(typeof wpfront_scroll_top == "function" && typeof jQuery !== "undefined") {wpfront_scroll_top({"scroll_offset":400,"button_width":0,"button_height":0,"button_opacity":0.8,"button_fade_duration":200,"scroll_duration":400,"location":1,"marginX":100,"marginY":100,"hide_iframe":false,"auto_hide":false,"auto_hide_after":2});} else {setTimeout(wpfront_scroll_top_init, 100);}}wpfront_scroll_top_init();</script><script async="" src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script><script>  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');  ga('create', 'UA-3115931-6', 'auto');  ga('require', 'displayfeatures');  ga('send', 'pageview');</script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.4.1"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="plugins/wpfront-scroll-top/js/wpfront-scroll-top.min.js?ver=1.5"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.4.1/jquery.easing.min.js?ver=4.8.9"></script><script type="text/javascript">  var colomatduration = 'fast';  var colomatdirection = 'left';  var colomatslideEffect = 'slideFade';  var colomatcookielife = 7;</script><link rel="stylesheet" id="metaslider-public-css" href="plugins/ml-slider/assets/metaslider/public.css?ver=3.5.1" type="text/css" media="all" property="stylesheet"><script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery/ui/effect.min.js?ver=1.11.4"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery/ui/effect-slide.min.js?ver=1.11.4"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="plugins/collapse-pro-matic/js/collapsepro.js?ver=1.5.9"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="plugins/ml-slider/assets/sliders/flexslider/jquery.flexslider-min.js?ver=3.5.1"></script>  <script type="text/javascript">    jQuery.noConflict();    (function( $ ) {      $(function(){        var keys = [        '#metaslider_87',        '#metaslider_164',        '#metaslider_127',        '#metaslider_94',        '#metaslider_140'        ]        for (var i = keys.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {          var key = keys[i];          $(key)            .addClass('flexslider')            .flexslider({              slideshowSpeed:3000,              animation:"fade",              controlNav:false,              directionNav:true,              pauseOnHover:true,              direction:"horizontal",              reverse:false,              animationSpeed:600,              prevText:"&lt;",              nextText:"&gt;",              slideshow:true            });        };      });    })(jQuery);  </script></body></html>
